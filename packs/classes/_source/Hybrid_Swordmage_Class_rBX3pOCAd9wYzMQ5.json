As a standard action, you can call your bonded weapon to your hand from up to 10 squares away.</p>\n<p>You can forge a bond with a different blade using the same meditation process (for instance, if you acquire a new blade that has magical abilities). If you forge a bond with a different blade, the old bond dissipates.</p>\n<p>If your bonded weapon is broken or damaged, you can spend 1 hour of meditation to recreate the weapon from a fragment. (This process automatically destroys any other fragments of the weapon in existence, so you can't use it to create multiple copies of a broken weapon.)</p>\n<p><strong>Swordmage Aegis (Hybrid) </strong></p>\n<p>This class feature functions as the swordmage class feature, except that you can use the power that you choose only once per encounter. However, you regain the use of that power when its target drops to 0 hit points or when its mark is superseded by another mark.</p>\n<p><strong>Hybrid talent Options</strong></p>\n<p>If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options.</p>\n<p><strong>Swordmage Warding </strong></p>\n<p>While you are conscious and wielding either a light blade or a heavy blade, you maintain a field of magical force around you.</p>\n<p>This field provides a +1 bonus to AC, or a +3 bonus if you are wielding a blade in one hand and have your other hand free (not carrying a shield, an off-hand weapon, a two-handed weapon, or anything else).</p>\n<p>Suggested Combinations</p>\n<p>Most hybrid swordmages sacrifice some of their defense for greater versatility. Combining the hybrid swordmage with the hybrid wizard gives you a great breadth of powers that share the same key ability.</p>\n<p>If you're dedicated to staying in melee, consider adding the hybrid warlord, and put your Intelligence to good use as a tactician.</p>\n<p>Although the hybrid swordmage and the hybrid shaman might seem incompatible, the spirit companion and the spirit's fangs power give a swordmage an extra option for battlefield control that doesn't require you to stay in the forefront every round.</p>\n<p>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 152.</p>",
