			"value":"<p><strong>Role: </strong>Defender. You are extremely durable, with high hit points and the ability to wear the heaviest armor. You can issue bold challenges to foes and compel them to fight you rather than your allies.</p>\n<p><strong>Power Source: </strong>Divine. You are a divine warrior, a crusader and protector of your faith.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Abilities: </strong>Strength, Charisma, Wisdom</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Proficiencies: </strong>Cloth, leather, hide, chainmail, scale, plate; heavy shields, light shields.</p>\n<p><strong>Weapon Proficiencies: </strong>Simple melee, military melee, simple ranged.</p>\n<p><strong>Implement: </strong>Holy Symbol</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus to Defense: </strong>+1 Fortitude, +1 Reflex, +1 Will.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level </strong>: 15+ Constitution Score.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points per Level Gained </strong>: 6</p>\n<p><strong>Healing Surges per Day </strong>: 10+ Constitution Modifier.</p>\n<p><strong>Trained Skills </strong>: Religion. From the class skills list below, choose 3 more trained skills at 1st level.</p>\n<p><em>Class Skills </em>: Diplomacy (Cha), Endurance (Con), Heal (Wis), History (Int), Insight (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Religion (Int).</p>\n<p><strong>Build Options: </strong>Ardent Paladin, Avenging Paladin, Protecting Paladin, Virtuous Paladin.</p>\n<p><strong>Class features: </strong>Channel Divinity, Divine Challenge, Lay on Hands.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>PALADIN CLASS FEATURES </strong></p>\n<p>Your armor, your shield, and your weapon are the most important tools of your trade. In addition, you have the following class features. Your lay on hands class feature can be replaced by the ardent vow or the virtue's touch class feature.</p>\n<p><strong>Channel Divinity </strong></p>\n<p>Once per encounter you can invoke divine power, filling yourself with the might of your patron deity. With the divine might you invoke you can wield special powers. You can also learn other uses for this feature; for instance, the divinity feats grant characters with access to the Channel Divinity class feature the ability to use additional special powers.</p>\n<p>You gain two Channel Divinity powers:<em>divine mettle </em>and<em>divine strength </em>. Regardless of how many different uses for Channel Divinity you know, you can use only one such ability per encounter. The special ability or power you invoke works just like your other powers.</p>\n<p><strong>Divine Challenge </strong></p>\n<p>The challenge of a paladin is filled with divine menace. You can use the divine challenge power to mark an enemy of your choice.</p>\n<p>Divine Challenge; </p>\n<p><strong>Lay On Hands </strong></p>\n<p>Using the lay on hands power, paladins can grant their comrades additional resilience with a touch of their hands and a short prayer, though they must give of their own strength to do so.</p>\n<p>Lay On Hands; </p>\n<p><strong>Alternative Paladin Features </strong></p>\n<p>Benefit; Ardent Vow; Virtue's Touch; </p>\n<p>DIVINE SANCTION</p>\n<p>Many new paladin powers and some of the new feats in this book subject a target to your divine sanction. Being subject to it means the target is marked by you for a duration specified in the description of the power or feat. Unless otherwise noted, the mark ends before the specified duration if someone else marks the target.</p>\n<p>Until the mark ends, the target takes radiant damage equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier the first time each round it makes an attack that doesn't include you as a target. The damage increases to 6 + your Charisma modifier at 11th level and 9 + your Charisma modifier at 21st level.</p>\n<p>Divine sanction is meant to complement divine challenge. You can use divine challenge to mark one creature and use divine sanction to mark others. Divine sanction has fewer restrictions than divine challenge so that you can easily use the two in concert.</p>\n<p>PALADINS AND DEITIES</p>\n<p>As fervent crusaders in their chosen cause, paladins must choose a deity. Paladins choose a specific faith to serve, as well as an alignment. You must choose an alignment identical to the alignment of your patron deity; a paladin of a good deity must be good, a paladin of a lawful good deity must be lawful good, and a paladin of an unaligned deity must be unaligned. Evil and chaotic evil paladins do exist in the world, but they are almost always villains, not player characters.</p>\n<p>Paladins are not granted their powers directly by their deity, but instead through various rites performed when they first become paladins. Most of these rites involve days of prayer, vigils, tests and trials, and ritual purification followed by a knighting ceremony, but each faith has its own methods. This ceremony of investiture gives a paladin the ability to wield divine powers. Once initiated, the paladin is a paladin forevermore. How justly, honorably, or compassionately the paladin wields those powers from that day forward is up to him, and paladins who stray too far from the tenets of their faith are punished by other members of the faithful.</p>\n<p>Good, Lawful Good, and Unaligned Deities</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Deity </strong></td>\n<td><strong>Alignment </strong></td>\n<td><strong>Areas of Influence </strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Avandra</td>\n<td>Good</td>\n<td>Change, luck, trade, travel</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bahamut</td>\n<td>Lawful Good</td>\n<td>Justice, honor, nobility, protection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Corellon</td>\n<td>Unaligned</td>\n<td>Arcane magic, spring, beauty, the arts</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Erathis</td>\n<td>Unaligned</td>\n<td>Civilization, invention, laws</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ioun</td>\n<td>Unaligned</td>\n<td>Knowledge, prophecy, skill</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Kord</td>\n<td>Unaligned</td>\n<td>Storms, strength, battle</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Melora</td>\n<td>Unaligned</td>\n<td>Wilderness, sea</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Moradin</td>\n<td>Lawful Good</td>\n<td>Creation, artisans, family</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pelor</td>\n<td>Good</td>\n<td>Sun, summer, agriculture, time</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Raven Queen</td>\n<td>Unaligned</td>\n<td>Death, fate, winter</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sehanine</td>\n<td>Unaligned</td>\n<td>Trickery, moon, love, autumn</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>IMPLEMENTS </strong></p>\n<p>Paladins make use of holy symbols to help channel and direct their divine powers. A paladin wearing or holding a magic holy symbol can add its enhancement bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls to powers that have the implement keyword. Without a holy symbol, a paladin can still use these powers, but he or she doesn't gain the bonus provided by the magic implement.</p>\n<p>A holy avenger, a special magic weapon, can also be used as an implement for paladin powers, as well as paladin paragon path powers. These weapons are highly sought after by paladins.</p>\n<p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 89.</p>",
