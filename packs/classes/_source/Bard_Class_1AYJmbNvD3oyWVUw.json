Without a wand, you can still use these powers.</p>\n<p>Songblades and some magic musical instruments (see Chapter 3) can be used as implements for bard powers and bard paragon path powers. Bards treasure these magic musical instruments not only for the power they offer, but for the wondrous melodies they produce in the hands of a skilled musician.</p>\n<p>Published in Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 66.</p>",
