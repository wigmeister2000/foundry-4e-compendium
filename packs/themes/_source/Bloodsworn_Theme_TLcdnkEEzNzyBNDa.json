			"value":"<p><em>\"My enemies must pay for their crimes, and the only payment I will accept is in blood.\"</em></p>\n<p>Evil emerges from below to work villainy on the innocent. Those of good heart stand against its machinations and struggle to rebuild in the aftermath of the conflict. For bloodsworn, though, guarding against wickedness is not enough. They take the fight to their enemies in a quest to destroy them all. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evil creates the situation that brings a bloodsworn into existence. Some terrible event sows the seeds of vengeance in an individual's heart, goading him or her to take up sword and staff to fight back against the darkness and ensure that evil never rears its head again. Often, bloodsworn are survivors of slaughters, whether from goblin marauding, a dark cult's sacrifices, or grimlock raids. Swearing bitter vows to the gods or to their dead comrades, bloodsworn travel a path of righteous vengeance.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Bloodsworn Starting Feature (1st level)</strong>: You gain the bloodied determination power.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Bloodsworn Level 5 Feature (5th level)</strong>: When you use your second wind, you gain a +2 power bonus to attack rolls until the end of your next turn.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Bloodsworn Level 10 Feature (10th level)</strong>: You gain a +2 power bonus to initiative checks and Intimidate checks.</p>",
