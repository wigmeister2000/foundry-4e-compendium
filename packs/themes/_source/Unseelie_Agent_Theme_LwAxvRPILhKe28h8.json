			"value":"<p><em>\"Go now&mdash;and do not let those fool eladrin know it is I whom you truly serve.\"</em></p>\n<p>The Feywild is a place of magic and enchantment, but within its shadows lurk creatures of mischief, malice, and malevolence that are the source of horrific campfire tales told about the plane. At best, these dark fey, or Unseelie, are indifferent about the harm they cause with their actions. At worst, they are creatures that carry the taint of shadow magic and seek to snuff out the light of the world.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite their reputation, these fey attract outsiders seeking their favor&mdash;some people just cannot resist the lure of dark magic. The Unseelie are well versed in the shadowy arts and, like many other fey creatures, love the power of bargains. They haggle and barter for what they have to offer, sometimes taking more than the seeker wants to pay in exchange. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are one such seeker. You came to an Unseelie fey creature in search of knowledge, favors, a weapon, a charm, or something else. The asking price was too high, so you pledged yourself into your patron's service instead. As is the case with many fey pledges, the duration of your service seems open to interpretation. In the meantime, you act as an agent of your patron well beyond the borders of its dominion.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tasks that your Unseelie master asks you to perform do not seem suspicious, and they follow no pattern that you have been able to discern. In fact, most of what you are called to do seems trivial&mdash;delivering messages, transporting money or goods, and reporting back on individuals that you observe. Your patron has yet to ask you to do something truly odious, although you realize that such a request might be made one day.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In exchange for your service, your Unseelie patron bestows gifts upon you. At the outset of your bargain, your patron gave you a shadow-wrought weapon, a magic item that cements the bond between you. In addition, your master occasionally teaches you small magic tricks or gives you insight into the workings of higher fey powers, expanding your knowledge and expertise. You worry, however, that every gift you receive leaves you further indebted to the Unseelie fey creature, and you fear that it might be difficult, perhaps impossible, to free yourself from its grasp.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Unseelie Agent Starting Feature (1st level)</strong>: You gain the create shadow-wrought weapon power. When you select the Unseelie agent theme, choose a melee weapon or a ranged weapon with which you have proficiency. The weapon created by this power is the same kind of weapon.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Unseelie Agent Level 5 Feature (5th level)</strong>: You can speak, read, and write the secret language of the Unseelie fey. This language can be used to communicate securely with others of your ilk.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Unseelie Agent Level 10 Feature (10th level)</strong>: When you make an Intimidate check, you can roll twice and use either result. When you do so, you physically change for a moment, revealing to the person you are attempting to intimidate that you have a supernatural connection to a dark power.</p>",
