			"value":"<p><em>\"I can still feel them crawling in the back of my mind, but they'll never get me again&mdash;not if I have anything to say about it.\"</em></p>\n<p>In the deepest caverns, where the sun is but a myth and the weight of the world crushes all hope, abominations haunt the dark. These perverse beings&mdash;aboleths, mind flayers, and worse&mdash;exert a loathsome control over the minds of others. Few who become their slaves ever return. Yet some of dauntless resolve do escape, though they are forever burdened by the scars of their slavery. The lingering voice of the master echoes just beyond comprehension in the backs of their minds.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Escaped Thrall Starting Feature (1st level)</strong>: You gain 1 power point.
