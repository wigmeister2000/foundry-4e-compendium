			"value":"<p>Like the misshapen fomorians and their cyclops servants, an oracle of the evil eye has a deformed eye with a catlike iris. The eye grants the oracle influence over the minds of other creatures and the ability to see glimpses of the future. People fear and shun anyone with an evil eye, and often rightly so.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baleful Ritual of the Evil Eye causes an evil eye to appear. This ritual&mdash;known to the fomorians, some of their servants, and a scattered few hags and spellcasters&mdash;takes hours to perform and is extremely painful, involving burning oils, foul incense, and surgical incisions. Fomorians, well known for their wickedness and insanity, might order that the ritual be conducted for many reasons. A ruler might give an evil eye as a gift to a faithful servant one day, then issue one as a punishment to a prisoner the next.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the cruelest creatures consider gaining an evil eye to be a blessing. Evil fey such as quicklings and spriggans thrill at the power of an evil eye, and eagerly do the work of the fomorians in exchange for such a blessing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most oracles of the evil eye who undertake adventuring careers are gnomes or eladrin. Forced to undergo the ritual, they become outcasts from their home societies. They go off into the woods of the Feywild, never to be seen again, or they travel to the natural world to lurk on the fringes of society and use their evil eyes to get what they want. An oracle of the evil eye might be adventuring in search of a way to dispel the curse and return to the warmth and comfort of society.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Oracle of the Evil Eye Starting Feature (1st level)</strong>: You gain the gaze of the evil eye power.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Oracle of the Evil Eye Level 5 Feature (5th level)</strong>: You gain a +2 power bonus to Bluff checks and Intimidate checks.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Oracle of the Evil Eye Level 10 Feature (10th level)</strong>: You gain low-light vision, or you gain darkvision if you already had low-light vision.</p>",
