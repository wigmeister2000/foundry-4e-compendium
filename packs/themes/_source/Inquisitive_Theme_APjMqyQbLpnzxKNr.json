			"value":"<p>When a merchant wants to know which employee is stealing from her, or when a nobleman wishes his wastrel son located, or when a farmer's wife needs evidence of her husband's infidelity, it's time to hire an inquisitive. These private detectives use a combination of skill, intuition, well-placed informants, and magic to solve crimes, locate missing persons, and unearth sensitive information. In short, an inquisitive is the perfect career for an adventurer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most inquisitives labor as private detectives, operate in urban areas (although their investigations can take them far afield), and work alone or with a small group of close associates. Those in larger cities, however, sometimes band together to form detective agencies or professional guilds. Such agencies might employ one to four inquisitives, as well as support staff such as alchemists, sages, and diviners. The larger and most successful organizations might have over a dozen detectives and numerous other operatives. Inquisitives who work independently or in smaller towns might operate out of taverns, restaurants, or even their own homes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the profession is not legal or welcome in every jurisdiction, inquisitives can have a complicated relationship with local law enforcement. Some watch commanders and local constables view inquisitives as necessary evils, despite keeping several on retainer to investigate complex or high-profile crimes. Overwhelmed subordinates can have a much more pragmatic view. Thus, a successful inquisitive cultivates reciprocal relationships with low-ranking officers and watch members, since they're an excellent source of jobs, information, and favors. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inquisitives perform a wide variety of services that can be grouped into three broad categories:criminal investigation, crime prevention, and information acquisition. Most inquisitives will take on any such cases. Some inquisitives and their agencies, however, especially those located in larger cities, specialize in a particular field. To solve cases, inquisitives utilize magic and skills to analyze evidence, conduct surveillance, interview witnesses,<br>interrogate suspects, and obtain privileged information by using a network of informants. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Inquisitive Starting Feature (1st level)</strong>: Work with your DM to build a small network of contacts&mdash;three to five individuals. It takes 2d6 hours for your contacts to respond to your requests, so you can turn to your network for help only once per day. Your contacts aid you as long as doing so does not pose a significant risk to them. Your DM decides whether your contacts can and<br>will help you, and if their help is valuable. If your DM determines that your contacts cannot help you, you learn that fact within 1d4 hours, and you don't expend the use of this feature. When your contacts aid you, choose one of following benefits:<br><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhCwALAMQSAEVCVlsyRmEyRWAyRWYyRURCVlcyRmQyRVI7T09FWGIyRVUyRlUyR1EzSHQyQ05EV0RCVyIyTH8yQgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAABIALAAAAAALAAsAAAUsoCSKwWiKCnSaUbSsUtFG5ShAc4s4UpL/DAkBl2ucHrMBDBAxwESAp+hwCgEAOw==\" alt=\"\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A +4 power bonus to one knowledge check, Streetwise check, or any other check the DM decides the contact can aid you with. If you succeed on the check because of your contact, you receive the desired information from the contact. <br><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhCwALAMQSAEVCVlsyRmEyRWAyRWYyRURCVlcyRmQyRVI7T09FWGIyRVUyRlUyR1EzSHQyQ05EV0RCVyIyTH8yQgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAABIALAAAAAALAAsAAAUsoCSKwWiKCnSaUbSsUtFG5ShAc4s4UpL/DAkBl2ucHrMBDBAxwESAp+hwCgEAOw==\" alt=\"\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 10 percent discount on the listed price of one item or service. Mundane items and services are readily obtainable at this discount, but your DM determines the availability of anything costing more than 50 gp.<br><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhCwALAMQSAEVCVlsyRmEyRWAyRWYyRURCVlcyRmQyRVI7T09FWGIyRVUyRlUyR1EzSHQyQ05EV0RCVyIyTH8yQgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAABIALAAAAAALAAsAAAUsoCSKwWiKCnSaUbSsUtFG5ShAc4s4UpL/DAkBl2ucHrMBDBAxwESAp+hwCgEAOw==\" alt=\"\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minor aid or insight, such as leaving a side door unlocked, introducing you to someone, or providing you with the name of a local fence. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Inquisitive Level 5 Feature (5th level)</strong>: Whenever you make an Insight check, you can roll twice and use either result.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Inquisitive Level 10 Feature (10th level)</strong>: Whenever you make a Perception check, you can roll twice and use either result.</p>",
