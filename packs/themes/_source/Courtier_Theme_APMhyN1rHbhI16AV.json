			"value":"<p><strong>Prerequisite: </strong>You must be trained in Diplomacy. The games of court are about winning allies and subtle persuasion, which is impossible without at least some knowledge of the art of diplomacy.<br><br>Most adventurers stick out like a troll among halflings when placed in courtly situations. They see only a bunch of nobles and retainers fawning over one another in incomprehensible ways with little relevance to their lives.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A courtier knows better. A battle rages amid the smiles and niceties of court. Each word is a carefully calculated move, each meeting a play for political power, and each friend another piece in the game of court. A single mistake can mean the difference between acquiring a powerful position and being clapped in irons.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A courtier sees unique solutions to a problem. When confronted by a wicked duke, a typical adventurer might launch an assault on his keep or try to assassinate him. A courtier might instead go to the king and plant the idea that the duke's wicked acts are a political liability. The villainous duke could soon be stripped of his lands and titles, thus ending his threat just as effectively.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Courtier Starting Feature (1st level)</strong>: Whenever you make a Diplomacy check, you can roll twice and take the higher result.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Courtier Level 5 Feature (5th level)</strong>: Whenever you would make a Bluff check, you can make a Diplomacy check instead.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Courtier Level 10 Feature (10th level)</strong>: Whenever you would make a Streetwise check to gather information in a settlement, you can make a Diplomacy check instead.</p>",
