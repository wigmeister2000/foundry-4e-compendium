			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Vampiric Heritage feat </p><p>With the innate ability to sniff out the undead, you have dedicated your life to the stalking and slaying of such abominations. Perhaps the calling of this vocation was passed down from your parents as a macabre tradition. Maybe vengeance has motivated you to slay the unliving. Perhaps you've turned your birthright into an asset that allows you to protect those weaker than you. You have channeled your sharp perception into deadly accuracy and slippery maneuverability-both of which also serve you against the living. </p><p><b>DEADSTALKER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Deadstalker's Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you do not grant combat advantage to any enemy for any reason and cannot be grabbed until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Indomitable Blood (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain a +2 bonus to saving throws against charm and fear effects. </p><p><b>Deadeye (16th level)</b></p><p>Once per round you gain a +5 bonus to damage rolls against a single undead target you hit with an attack. </p><p><b>DEADSTALKER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.3xKYlZkfwTav48y0]{Deadstalker 11-Impaling Blow}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.lrnZuSO5F1dIDBXV]{Deadstalker 12-Deadwalker Instant Escape}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.kqCJ9IjMU1XyeGg2]{Deadstalker 20-Deadeye Strike}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 371, page(s) 36. </p>",
