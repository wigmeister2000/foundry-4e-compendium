			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Dragonborn, any primal class, dragon breath power that deals lightning damage </p><p>Some dragons are like forces of nature, the elemental power coursing through their bodies akin to the mightiest forces of storm, earth, or sea. The catastrophic dragons embody the destructive forces of nature, but even the blue dragon is a living incarnation of the storm. Your mastery of primal magic has led you to this path: Like these dragons, the power of the storm flows in your blood and erupts in your breath. </p><p>Your allies in the spirit world are draconic spirits of wind, lightning, and thunder, heeding your call to rebuke your enemies, carry your allies on the wind, or transport you through the storm. As you advance on the path of the storm dragon, your appearance changes to reflect the nature spirits you commune with-you might develop the blue scales and prominent horn of a blue dragon, or something of the churning elemental appearance of a typhoon dragon. By the time you reach the end of the path, wings sprout from your back, and you fight with all the savagery of the storm dragon. </p><p><b>STORM DRAGON PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Storm Spirit (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain resist 10 lightning and resist 10 thunder. </p><p><b>Thundering Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to make an attack, you can push each target you hit with that attack a number of squares equal to your Charisma modifier and knock each target prone. </p><p><b>Soul of the Storm Dragon (16th level)</b></p><p>Your primal powers ignore the target's resistance to lightning or thunder. </p><p><b>Storm Dragon Wings (16th level)</b></p><p>You gain overland flight with a speed of 8. </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook Races: Dragonborn, page(s) 21. </p>",
