			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Forgeborn Heritage </p><p>The ancient curse forgeborn dwarves carry manifests itself in different ways. Although united in their uncommon appearance and the single-minded zeal with which they attack their enemies, a few dwarves, often the greatest heroes in their clans, manifest incredible power on the battlefield. When the fury is upon them, their bodies erupt in brilliant flames, obscuring their forms and scorching their enemies. Few forgeborn dwarves endure these transformations. Even the healthiest dwarves cannot withstand the fires burning within them for long, but a rare few learn to control the flames and to use them when most needed so they can destroy the foes they despise. </p><p><b>FIREFORGED CHAMPION PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Forged in Flame (11th level)</b></p><p>Increase your resistance to fire by one-half your level, and your attacks ignore an amount of fire resistance equal to your level. </p><p><b>Scorching Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to make an extra melee attack and you hit with this attack, each enemy adjacent to your target takes 10 fire damage. At 21st level, increase this to 15 damage. </p><p><b>Fire for Blood (16th level)</b></p><p>While you are bloodied, any creature that starts its turn in a square adjacent to you takes 5 fire damage. This damage increases to 10 at 21st level. </p><p><b>FIREFORGED CHAMPION POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.oDLhXIM0y21WcQpP]{Fireforged Champion 11-Forge Strike}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.ZXVtbfW7AxKHnPhz]{Fireforged Champion 12-Burning Recollection}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.VZ5hU3oxDpEsHlqm]{Fireforged Champion 20-Form of the Forge Spirit}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 383, page(s) 74. </p>",
