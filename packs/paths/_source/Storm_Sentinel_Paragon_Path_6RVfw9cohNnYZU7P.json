			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warden </p><p>To many, there is no clearer expression of the power of nature than the raging fury of the storm. Churning clouds, crashing thunder, and blasting lightning are manifestations of the rage coursing through the world when its natural laws are violated and its purity corrupted. When gods or primordials overstep their bounds, when demons or aberrant beings try to tear the fabric of reality, the fury of a storm-and its cleansing rain-are part of nature's response. </p><p>Most wardens draw power from the earth. As an incarnation of the storm's wrath, your greatest primal power comes from the sky. Lightning flows in your veins, and thunder booms in your footsteps. As you advance along this path, you can transform yourself into wind and rain and can ultimately take on the aspect of storm's wrath. </p><p><b>STORM SENTINEL PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Critical Jolt (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you score a critical hit, it deals extra lightning damage equal to your Strength modifier. </p><p><b>Invigorating Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to make an attack, you can spend a healing surge as a free action after the attack. </p><p><b>Undying Wind (16th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you spend a healing surge, you regain additional hit points equal to your Constitution modifier. </p><p><b>STORM SENTINEL POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.IakDiUKdZQzJ6jrT]{Storm Sentinel 11-Thunder Smash}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.3bOzH4ih0LKJYsUG]{Storm Sentinel 12-Storm Step}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.3bCElv4gW5p9Qs68]{Storm Sentinel 20-Form of Storm's Wrath}</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 168. </p>",
