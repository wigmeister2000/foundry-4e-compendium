			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Wilden </p><p>You dream of leaves shining in the sun, giving you the strength of ten. You dream of roots burrowing into the earth, providing unyielding support. You dream of towering over your foes as tree looks down on undergrowth. Then you open your eyes and smile, because it is no dream. </p><p>You have embraced your origins and have learned the trick of manifesting a strength few others can hope to match, either in raw power or in size. You reach for this strength as a guardian of living things everywhere, be they plants or animals, as well as humanoids who've learned to live in harmony with nature. </p><p>For those who can't learn coexistence, you have nothing but disdain. If their crimes are severe enough, you act swiftly, showing the enemies of life the error of their ways. </p><p>When combat beckons, your height begins to increase. Like a stem seeking the sun, your torso and limbs lengthen as the battle rages, and they reach farther and farther until you can manipulate your foes as if you were a much larger creature. </p><p><b>TREEBORN PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Reaching for the Canopy (11th level)</b></p><p>When you use a wilden racial power, increase your reach with melee attacks by 1 until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Reaching Limbs Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action that includes a melee attack and you hit with that attack, you can slide the target 4 squares. </p><p><b>Treeborn Action (16th level)</b></p><p>You can score critical hits on a roll of 19-20 with melee attacks against creatures granting combat advantage to you. </p><p><b>TREEBORN POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.U0FXtARsfhblqP95]{Treeborn 11-Lashing Branches}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.Nd8ZohRWC7rjFIeg]{Treeborn 12-Root Sense}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.SrZmflA6Ct92sKRj]{Treeborn 20-Walking Sentinel}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 388. </p>",
