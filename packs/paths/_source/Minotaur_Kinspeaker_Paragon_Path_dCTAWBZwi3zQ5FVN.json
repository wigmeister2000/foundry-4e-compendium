			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Minotaur, leader role </p><p>Each generation leaves behind the ashes of the old, but the spirits of the past live on for those with the eyes to see them and the ears to hear them. You dwell in two worlds, opening your inner awareness to look upon death and tease out its secrets. You commune with these spirits, seeking out their advice and divining solutions to your troubles by solving their riddles. Their signs are everywhere-even in the omens you see and the portents you dream. </p><p><b>MINOTAUR KINSPEAKER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Ancestral Allies (11th level)</b></p><p>Ancestor spirits swirl around you. When you hit an enemy with an opportunity attack, the target grants combat advantage to you and your allies until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Counseled Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, each ally that can see and hear you can reroll all failed skill checks until the end of your next turn. The ally must keep the second result. </p><p><b>Lend Spiritual Aid (16th level)</b></p><p>When an ally within 5 squares of you that can see and hear you spends an action point to make an attack, that ally gains concealment until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>MINOTAUR KINSPEAKER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.uB1D3ow2VEZYf5NU]{Minotaur Kinspeaker 11-Unleashed Beast}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.BEolnstKmNqCOz57]{Minotaur Kinspeaker 12-Ancestral Congress}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.mNpZ2S6bug3GWJBK]{Minotaur Kinspeaker 20-Ancestral Possession}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 369, page(s) 11. </p>",
