			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Wizard class </p><p>You didn't leave behind the thrill of battle when you took up the mantle of wizard, so why should you stand back and let the fighters have all the fun? You have developed skills and techniques that have turned you into a true battle mage, ready to deal damage up close and personal or from afar, depending on the situation and how the mood strikes you. You have even learned of a technique for using arcane energy to temporarily stave off death-and you can't wait to try it out in battle! </p><p><b>BATTLE MAGE PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Arcane Riposte (11th level)</b></p><p>When a creature provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can make an opportunity attack with one of your hands (Intelligence + 4 vs. Reflex). The bonus increases to +6 at 21st level. Choose cold, fire, force, or lightning. On a hit, the attack deals 1d8 + Intelligence modifier damage of that type. </p><p><b>Battle Mage Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you also gain a +4 bonus to attack rolls until the start of your next turn. </p><p><b>Battle Edge (16th level)</b></p><p>When you first become bloodied in an encounter, you can use any at-will power you know as an immediate reaction. </p><p><b>BATTLE MAGE POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.DKbmlg9PW0YLQ16X]{Battle Mage 11-Forceful Retort}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.IiOAs9mfXrYdaew8]{Battle Mage 12-Arcane Rejuvenation}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.cESb8aYC0VNJn4xk]{Battle Mage 20-Closing Spell}</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 169, Class Compendium. </p>",
