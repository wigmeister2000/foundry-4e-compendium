			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Shadar-kai </p><p>Regardless of your religious bent, the traditions of your people run strong in your veins. Those veins have spilled your own dark blood for fated deeds; and those deeds have, in turn, moved you along the road to fulfilling the dream almost every shadar-kai holds in mind and heart. The natural course of your life seems to be to fulfill your people's ancient pact against all those who stand in opposition to departing creation. Whether through your intentional strengthening of your shadar-kai nature or by happy chance, your body has grown strong in death. You are drawn to those who defy death and fate, especially creatures that have immortality-natural or otherwise. To such ones you deliver the sweet freedom of death, sending them into the arms they sought to avoid. Their resistance is for naught. You are a representative of the inevitable. In your terrifying strength you abide-perhaps one day in immortality justly granted, but certainly in legend. </p><p><b>ABIDING REAPER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Blood Calling (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you bloody a target, that target grants you combat advantage until it is no longer bloodied. </p><p><b>Deathly Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to make an attack, that attack ignores all resistances and insubstantial and shuts down the target's regeneration (if any) until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Hardened Spirit (16th level)</b></p><p>Whenever a creature makes an attack against your Fortitude or Will and misses, you gain temporary hit points equal to 1/2 your level + your Constitution modifier. </p><p><b>ABIDING REAPER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.mtkrh8cXPSIqs2MA]{Abiding Reaper 11-Reaping Disruption}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.hiQJK36ZHqGkjzX4]{Abiding Reaper 12-Fearsome Revival}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.QicSvdKL0arO8oI4]{Abiding Reaper 20-Reaper's Repast}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 372, page(s) 13. </p>",
