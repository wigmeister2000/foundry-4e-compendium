			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Battlemind </p><p>The Order of the Eternal Blade is a secretive group, but you sought out its masters and gained entry. Whatever drove you to the order, you knew you made the right choice when the masters first instructed you. On that day, you first learned to communicate with your blade guide, the psychic resonance of generations of eternal blades that came before you. </p><p>The order's first members foresaw the emergence of psionic magic. When those members died, they cast their minds forward in time in search of worthy heirs to their cause. You are one such heir. Your blade guide lingers near you, teaching you the fighting arts of the eternal blades. Even if you fall in battle, your experience shall not be lost, for you too shall cast your mind forward in search of a new champion to guide. </p><p><b>ETERNAL BLADE PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Blade Guide (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain the blade guide power. </p><p><b>Guided Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can reroll your next attack roll that misses before the end of your turn. </p><p><b>Paragon Power Points (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain 2 additional power points. </p><p><b>Eternal Warrior (16th level)</b></p><p>When you drop to 0 hit points or fewer, the dying condition neither causes you to fall unconscious nor forces you to make death saving throws until the end of your next turn. </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 58. </p>",
