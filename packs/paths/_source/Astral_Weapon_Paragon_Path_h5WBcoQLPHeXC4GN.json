When you accept this path, the weapon you wield forevermore glows with the silvery light of the Astral Sea. </p><p><b>ASTRAL WEAPON PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Astral Judgment (11th level)</b></p><p>Enemies currently marked by you that attack your allies without attacking you take a -2 penalty to all defenses until they are no longer marked by you. </p><p><b>Astral Rejuvenation Action (11th level)</b></p><p>You can spend an action point to regain one paladin encounter power you have already used, instead of taking an extra action. </p><p><b>Courage from on High (16th level)</b></p><p>You gain a +2 bonus to saving throws against fear effects. </p><p><b>ASTRAL WEAPON POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.wGOcuxBbpVzlZMJ9]{Astral Weapon 11-Carving a Path of Light}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.in8V0Z3FXjOS2TGm]{Astral Weapon 12-Pray for More}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.lBLnamP8JzoTYrQD]{Astral Weapon 20-Astral Whirlwind}</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 100. </p>",
