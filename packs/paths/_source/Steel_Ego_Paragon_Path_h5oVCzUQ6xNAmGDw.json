			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Battlemind, mind spike power </p><p>Confidence is why you always win. Even when you are faced with a setback, your resolve never wavers, and you're certain you will overcome adversity no matter how severe. Some people mistake your confidence for arrogance or foolishness, but you prove the truth of your words time and again, showing your detractors your might. </p><p>You back up your confidence with your psionic mastery, wrapping your soul, body, and mind in a barrier of willpower to deflect any attack you face, whether it strikes your body or mind. With this unwavering resolve, you can dismiss a foe's strikes, standing undaunted before its best efforts to hurt you. And with this security, you project your personality onto those you fight, flooding their minds with the imminence of their defeat. </p><p><b>STEEL EGO PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Demanding Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can use your mind spike power as a free action until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Mind Smash (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you deal damage with your mind spike power, each enemy adjacent to the target takes psychic damage equal to your Charisma modifier. </p><p><b>Paragon Power Points (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain 2 additional power points. </p><p><b>Psionic Cascade (16th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you score a critical hit, you regain 1 power point. </p><p><b>STEEL EGO POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.JDLm1nRv8rsoSHgB]{Steel Ego 11-Stinging Rebuke}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.I1muFGla2BOho59c]{Steel Ego 12-Forceful Contempt}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.FvDGnw5rAeqkdE8Z]{Steel Ego 20-Fear and Loathing}</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 60. </p>",
