			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Shaman, call spirit companion power </p><p>Many shaman traditions revere the Great Bear as the perfect example of the protector spirit. As a mother bear furiously guards her cubs against danger, so the Great Bear stands guard over the world, protecting it from those who would destroy or corrupt it, and so too do you, as a Great Bear shaman, protect your adventuring companions. Your spirit companion is your link to the Great Bear, channeling its strength and endurance to you through your evocations. </p><p>Your main purpose is to stand alongside other warriors and make them stronger. When you can, protect the weak. When you cannot, strengthen the strong to make them better protectors. As you pursue the path of the Great Bear shaman, your spirit companion channels the power of the Great Bear to harry your enemies, punishing them when they attack your friends. Your companion roars with the ferocious strength of the Great Bear, galvanizing your allies into action. You give your allies additional attacks whenever you spur yourself to greater action, and you empower the attacks they make when enemies drop their guard. </p><p>You are the world's protector, and the Great Bear's roar echoes in every word you speak. </p><p><b>GREAT BEAR SHAMAN PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Great Bear's Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, one ally of your choice within 10 squares of you can make a melee basic attack as a free action, before or after the extra action. </p><p><b>Great Protector's Prowess (11th level)</b></p><p>You and your allies gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls against marked enemies adjacent to your spirit companion. </p><p><b>Looming Presence (16th level)</b></p><p>While adjacent to your spirit companion, your allies gain a +5 power bonus to attack rolls when making opportunity attacks. </p><p><b>GREAT BEAR SHAMAN POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.b3iuyTx1EPvIWBa7]{Great Bear Shaman 11-Bear Fang Defense}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.HKf9RhUleI5snkB6]{Great Bear Shaman 12-Galvanizing Bellow}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.b4uAVrl6nMEDvJqH]{Great Bear Shaman 20-Call to the Great Bear}</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 134. </p>",
