			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Cleric </p><p>Deception worms its way through the world, corroding morals and subverting ideals. Only through constant vigilance can this welling corruption be checked. Many divine servants battle obvious foes-undead, demons, and other foul creatures-but the enemies you face are far more insidious. You explore realms of shadow and deception, leading the fight against enemies who use guile instead of brutality. </p><p>To combat such forces, you armor yourself in the truth, using its radiance to burn away the lies and falsehoods your foes employ. In your presence, the enemy cannot hide or use its tricks, and it stands exposed before you. </p><p>Facing the worst sort of villains leaves its mark on you. You age prematurely, lines creasing your face, but such ravages of the body do not extend to your spirit. Each victory only firms your resolve. When you wield your truthseeker powers in the name of your god, your voice sounds like thunder and your enemies quail before your righteous presence. </p><p><b>TRUTHSEEKER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Censuring Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to use a divine attack power, until the end of your next turn, any enemy that ends its turn adjacent to you takes a -2 penalty to all defenses (save ends). </p><p><b>Healing Truth (11th level)</b></p><p>Each target of your healing word power gains a +2 power bonus to all defenses against fear, illusion, and polymorph effects until the end of the encounter. </p><p><b>Unequaled Clarity (16th level)</b></p><p>When you make an Insight check, you can roll twice and use either result. In addition, you gain a +4 bonus to passive Insight checks. </p><p><b>TRUTHSEEKER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.sHDq6IhJxacGoZj2]{Truthseeker 11-Corruption Unveiled}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.MrZF4ctREGHsbw1O]{Truthseeker 12-Shrine of Clarity}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.SQtMc2ZDqHhvUKep]{Truthseeker 20-Moment of Truth}</p><p>Published in Divine Power, page(s) 53. </p>",
