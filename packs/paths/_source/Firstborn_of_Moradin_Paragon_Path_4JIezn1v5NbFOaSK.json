			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Dwarf </p><p>At the dawn of creation, dwarven myths say, Moradin made the race of dwarves. His firstborn had bones cut from bedrock, souls wrought from iron, and hearts carved of gleaming diamonds. These firstborn were the models after which all other dwarves were patterned. </p><p>Although the firstborn of Moradin's making vanished in servitude to the giants, their fighting techniques and mystical traditions have not been lost. A new era of dwarven heroism has arrived, and the legacy of the firstborn continues. Those few who most skillfully follow the paths of the ancient firstborn are slowly transformed into the image of Moradin's firstborn. </p><p>As one of the present-day firstborn of Moradin, you forge a deep connection with the earth, tapping into the power that courses through the bedrock beneath your feet. You draw on the strength of the mountains to resist injury, expand your senses through rock and stone, and root yourself in the bones of the earth. You are the stuff new legends are made of. </p><p><b>FIRSTBORN OF MORADIN PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Stonebones (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you take a critical hit, roll a d20. If you roll 10 or higher, the critical hit turns into a normal hit. </p><p><b>Strength of the Earth (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can also spend a healing surge. </p><p><b>Dwarven Resurgence (16th level)</b></p><p>When you use your second wind, you make a saving throw against each effect on you that a save can end. </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 22. </p>",
