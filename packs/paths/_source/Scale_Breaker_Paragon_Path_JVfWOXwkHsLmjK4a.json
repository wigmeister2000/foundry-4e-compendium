			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Fighter </p><p>The lone warrior raising sword and shield against a fearsome wyrm is one of the most iconic images of dragon-slaying. You have trained long and hard to serve as that warrior, though with the intent of facing dragons alongside allies, not alone. Your martial tactics and techniques are such that even the deadliest dragons would do well to fear you. </p><p><b>SCALE-BREAKER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Dragon-Slayer's Action (11th level)</b></p><p>You can spend an action point to reroll an attack roll against a dragon, or to end a condition currently affecting you that originated from a dragon, and that a save can end. Using this feature replaces the normal action point benefit of taking an extra action. </p><p><b>Guardian Ally (11th level)</b></p><p>Each ally adjacent to you gains a +2 shield bonus to Reflex defense against close and area attacks while you wield a shield. </p><p><b>Dragon Hammer (16th level)</b></p><p>When you hit an enemy, that enemy takes a -1 penalty to Fortitude defense until the end of your next turn. If that enemy is a dragon, it also takes a -1 penalty to AC until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>SCALE-BREAKER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.Q4598Bfhcerm7C2a]{Scale-Breaker 11-Grounding Strike}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.AstBMjk9dGYygTba]{Scale-Breaker 12-Bear the Brunt}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.MJ1c4HigasUnFhzf]{Scale-Breaker 20-Scale-Shattering Strike}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 369, page(s) 48. </p>",
