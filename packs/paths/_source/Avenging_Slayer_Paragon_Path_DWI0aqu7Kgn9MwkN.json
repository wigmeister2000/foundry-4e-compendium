			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Fighter </p><p>Beyond a few safe havens, the world is an unforgiving land filled with cruelty, terror, and profound evil. The blameless are slaughtered and the works of civilization are torn down, sometimes in a bid for conquest, but just as often out of sheer brutality. Destructive monsters regularly leave behind survivors, and a few of these take up the sword or the axe. These brave souls seek not to put past wrongs right, but to prevent others from suffering as they have, and to slake a thirst for vengeance. In this way, heroism is often forged in darkness. </p><p>At some point in your life, your course was set, your path laid before you. Maybe your career as a grim hero began the moment you or those close to you fell victim to a fate you were powerless to prevent-your life forever changed by one act of depravity. Perhaps instead, as you have adventured, you've witnessed too many appalling acts, seen too many innocents buried, or found wickedness in too many shadows. Whatever the case, you now see yourself as the only one who can stand between the helpless few and the predatory hordes. You know no respite exists for those who would protect the weak. Even so, you willingly take on that task. </p><p>As an avenging slayer, your brutal efficiency makes you a menacing figure no enemy can safely ignore. You strike fear into your enemies to protect your allies and those who have less power than you. You punish corruption with merciless retribution, defining yourself as a righteous executioner. </p><p><b>AVENGING SLAYER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Bloodied Edge (11th level)</b></p><p>When you have combat advantage against a bloodied enemy, you gain a bonus to weapon damage rolls equal to your Charisma modifier. </p><p><b>Slayer's Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you gain combat advantage against an enemy marked by you until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Brutal Justice (16th level)</b></p><p>When you reduce a target marked by you to 0 hit points, you gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls until the end of your next turn. </p><p>Published in Martial Power, page(s) 24. </p>",
