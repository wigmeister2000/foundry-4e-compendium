			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Assassin </p><p>You are a venomed soul, a student of an ancient text called The Book of All Venoms. Zehir wrote this book at the dawn of creation, and within its pages he outlined the invention of every poison that is, was, and ever shall be. Over the centuries, several thieves have stolen fragments of the book, from adventurers desperate to find a poison's antidote to ambitious slayers eager to unleash poison so powerful that even Zehir balked at crafting them. </p><p><b>VENOMED SOUL PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Master of Poisons (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you take a short or an extended rest, you can poison one of your weapons or a piece of ammunition. Choose one of the poison effects given below. The next time you attack with the poisoned item before your next short or extended rest, the target suffers the chosen effect if the attack hits. The effect is lost if the attack misses. </p><p><img> </img>The target takes extra poison damage equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier. </p><p><img> </img>The target is immobilized until the end of your next turn. </p><p><img> </img>Until the end of your next turn, the target cannot see any creature more than 4 squares from it. </p><p><b>Poisoned Soul (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain resist 5 poison. The resistance increases to 10 at 21st level. </p><p><b>Venomous Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you gain a bonus to attack rolls equal to your Constitution modifier against enemies taking ongoing poison damage. The bonus lasts until the end of your next turn. In addition, you can apply a Master of Poisons effect to one of your weapons or a piece of ammunition. </p><p><b>Persistent Venom (16th level)</b></p><p>The poison effect of your Master of Poisons is no longer lost on a miss. Instead the first target hit by the poisoned item suffers the effect. </p><p><b>VENOMED SOUL POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.tJdZy5VRPMsTSQUn]{Venomed Soul 11-Inescapable Venom}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.LNw7EVIs81g4cfMj]{Venomed Soul 12-Venomous Kiss}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.jYi647LNcOp03eWI]{Venomed Soul 20-Soul Venom}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 379, page(s) 34. </p>",
