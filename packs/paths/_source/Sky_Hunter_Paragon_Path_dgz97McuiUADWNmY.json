			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Druid, wild shape power </p><p>Although the Primal Beast usually appears as a mammalian predator, some aspects of the Primal Beast soar through the sky on feathered wings, hunting prey from the air. Eagles, hawks, and falcons are no less fierce predators than panthers and wolves, and some druids assume their forms to fly after their own prey. </p><p>You are such a druid, a sky hunter who emulates birds of prey in your beast form. Your beast form can't always fly, but it can take to the air from time to time. Some sky hunters assume a beast form a little like a cockatrice-a stalking predator with primitive wings that allow it to fly in short bursts. Others retain their normal beast form but change momentarily into a bird form when they use their sky hunter powers. </p><p><b>SKY HUNTER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Master of Wings (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls against flying creatures. </p><p><b>Sky Hunter's Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can fly your speed before taking that action. </p><p><b>Beast Senses (16th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you use a beast form daily power, you gain a +5 power bonus to Perception checks until the end of the encounter. </p><p><b>SKY HUNTER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.o1EjVn0TguHIfrcZ]{Sky Hunter 11-Blinding Talons}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.8vFEiUjs6fPtc7Qb]{Sky Hunter 12-Soaring Falcon}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.uZox4A8awOdUEMIg]{Sky Hunter 20-Primal Eagle}</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 99. </p>",
