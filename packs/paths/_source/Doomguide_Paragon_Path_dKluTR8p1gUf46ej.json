			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Any Divine class; worship Kelemvor </p><p>Some mistake Kelemvor's single-minded focus on destroying undeath as a doomed obsession. As a Doomguide of Kelemvor, you might be willing to grant that your focus is obsessive. But doom? Doom is reserved for the undead and for those who prevent the spirits of the dead from seeking their proper destinations. </p><p><b>DOOMGUIDE PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Blessings of Kelemvor (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you gain a +2 bonus to all defenses until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Doomguide's Geas (11th level)</b></p><p>If you use a power that has the healing keyword, you restore an additional 2 hit points. While there are undead opponents within 10 squares of you, this benefit increases to 5 hit points. </p><p><b>Doomguide's Resolve (16th level)</b></p><p>When you drop an enemy to 0 hit points or fewer, you can immediately make a saving throw against one effect that a save can end. If you drop an undead enemy to 0 hit points or fewer, you can instead immediately make saving throws against all effects that a save can end. </p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Player's Guide, page(s) 50. </p>",
