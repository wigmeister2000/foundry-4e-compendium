			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Ardent </p><p>Though no chains bind them, your enemies become your prisoners. You are a psionic binder, a living prison whose thoughts are as strong as adamantine bonds. When you engage your foes, you redirect their thoughts inward, forming mental walls to constrain their thoughts and root them to the spot. You can keep your enemy imprisoned long enough for your allies to close in and deliver whatever justice the foe deserves. </p><p>The aberrant menace is a wily threat, slipping unseen into the mortal world and spreading its corrupting influence to foment unrest and mutation wherever it goes. No matter how many aberrant monsters are destroyed, others spawn to spread wickedness. The only answer is containment. By pinning down the threat, you can destroy it, one monster at a time. </p><p>By no means are your efforts exclusive to aberrant enemies. Any who stand against you in your single-minded pursuit deserve your dread attention. </p><p><b>PSIONIC BINDER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Constant Jailer (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you hit an immobilized creature with a melee or a close attack, that creature can't make saving throws on its next turn against effects that immobilize. </p><p><b>Imprisoning Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to make an attack and the attack hits, the target is also restrained (save ends). </p><p><b>Paragon Power Points (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain 2 additional power points. </p><p><b>Crushing Walls (16th level)</b></p><p>While you are adjacent to an immobilized enemy, that enemy grants combat advantage. </p><p><b>PSIONIC BINDER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.EvBbGAr2tyXpOJhk]{Psionic Binder 11-Binding Strike}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.WiGnLK5uIQmtgE0C]{Psionic Binder 12-Executioner's Summons}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.fZnVaEDjMBkTJ6Ku]{Psionic Binder 20-Perfect Prison}</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 39. </p>",
