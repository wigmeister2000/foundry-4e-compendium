			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warlock </p><p>The beacon that is Evermeet shines gloriously bright, even in the darkest of hours. You have tempered your warlock pact by communion with the ancient powers that dwell in the forests of the eladrin home island. The </p><p>spirits of Evermeet have the most to offer to warlocks who are already bound to other fey (those of the fey pact), but any warlock, regardless of his or her pact, can discover advantages of allying with Evermeet's pact-makers. </p><p>The almost-forgotten, gossamer spirits of Evermeet offer great boons to those who call upon their secret names, which have not been uttered by mortal lips for millennia. The fey of Evermeet move freely to and from the Feywild. With their aid you can wield powers that mere mortals were not meant to wield. </p><p>You are a light against the blackness, a beacon of hope in the coldest depths of night. </p><p><b>EVERMEET WARLOCK PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Feywild Wake (11th level)</b></p><p>When you leave a square by teleporting, you become invisible to all enemies adjacent to the square you left until the start of your next turn. </p><p><b>Mercurial Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you also gain a move action and your speed increases by 1 until the end of your turn. </p><p><b>Mastery of Passage (16th level)</b></p><p>When you teleport 10 squares or less, you can take one adjacent ally with you. Your ally appears in any square of your choice adjacent to your ending location. </p><p><b>EVERMEET WARLOCK POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.eJYPONUjhk1zrpxu]{Evermeet Warlock 11-Blinding Beacon}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.9xI3ku5dlpSEWqKX]{Evermeet Warlock 12-Feylights}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.5yQ0uPaMw1H6o4Gb]{Evermeet Warlock 20-Moonflower Inspiration}</p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Player's Guide, page(s) 54. </p>",
