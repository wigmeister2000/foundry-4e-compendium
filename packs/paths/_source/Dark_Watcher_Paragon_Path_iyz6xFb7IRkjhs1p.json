			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Good or lawful good alignment </p><p>The ancient order of the dark watchers was founded by arcanists who mastered the power of shadow, then matched that power with a righteous understanding of the light of life and the Astral Sea. As a dark watcher, you are a vigilant guardian of the light of life and the natural world. The power taught to you by the order grants you unmatched defensive prowess, allowing you to protect yourself and your allies from the forces of darkness. Only by embracing the shadow can its corruption be turned to light-or so you believe. </p><p><b>DARK WATCHER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Call for Vigilance (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain the call for vigilance power. </p><p><b>Righteous Beacon (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you spend an action point, you can choose to project bright light out to 5 squares until the end of your next turn. While in this light, allies gain a +4 bonus to all defenses and do not provoke opportunity attacks. </p><p><b>Righteous Vigilance (11th level)</b></p><p>When you hit an enemy with an opportunity attack that deals damage, you can choose to deal no damage with the attack. Instead, the enemy is weakened until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Constant Vigilance (12th level)</b></p><p>You gain the constant vigilance power. </p><p><b>Never Surrender to Darkness (16th level)</b></p><p>You die after failing four death saving throws, instead of three.
