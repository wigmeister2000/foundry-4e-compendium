			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warlock class, star pact </p><p>You studied the limitless abysses and the bright points of enigmatic light that hang between them. You listened </p><p>to the baffling disordered sounds that emerged from the simple astronomical lenses you used for your study. You learned the stars were not the innocent lamps above the world that most assumed. Despite this unsettling knowledge, you continued your study, eventually narrowing your concentration to just one star-a star named Caiphon. That's when the dreams began. </p><p>You dreamed of a fitful star of purple fire. You walked in its light to the edge of a slime-lined pit that pulsed and heaved like a living maw, eager to consume. You hurled yourself into the cavity as the purple star flared. You fell into an amoebic sea, where you were digested over the course of a thousand years, or perhaps just one night. </p><p>When you woke, your eyes were opalescent purple orbs, and Caiphon began whispering-whispering-into your ear. Even though you could hear only the merest fragments of Caiphon's never-ending instructions and insights, a knowing smile stitched itself across your face. </p><p><b>STUDENT OF CAIPHON PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Caiphon's Guidance (11th level)</b></p><p>Your fear or radiant warlock powers and student of Caiphon powers score critical hits on rolls of 18-20. </p><p><b>Star Bright (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, if you use your action to make an attack that hits, that hit deals ongoing 5 radiant damage (save ends). Such powers are considered to have the radiant keyword. </p><p><b>Caiphon's Intercession (16th level)</b></p><p>You can choose to use Caiphon's Intercession in place of your Fate of the Void pact boon when an enemy under your Warlock's Curse drops to 0 hit points or fewer. One ally of your choice within 10 squares of you can make an immediate melee basic attack against a target you choose; if the attack hits, it deals ongoing 5 radiant damage (save ends) in addition to normal damage. If your ally makes the attack, Caiphon takes its due and deals 5 damage to your ally. If your ally refuses to accept Caiphon's Intercession, you take 5 damage (despite the fact no attack was made); in such an instance, you retain the use of Fate of the Void. </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine Annual, Dragon Magazine 366, page(s) 24. </p>",
