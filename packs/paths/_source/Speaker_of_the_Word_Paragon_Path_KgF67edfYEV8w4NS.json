			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Invoker </p><p>You are an initiate in a rare tradition, one that embraces a unified religious concept summed up in one word of power. The Word was crafted by the gods to be a great weapon. Only the most trustworthy and compassionate invokers are taught the syllables of the Word, and even they seldom use its power. Each syllable, when spoken in the proper pitch and cadence, is a powerful prayer in its own right, and those brief tones are the most powerful weapons of your faith. </p><p>It is not enough simply to repeat the syllables that comprise the Word; to unleash its power you must desire to do so, speaking it exactly and framing the philosophical significance of each syllable in your mind as you say it. Uttering the Word unleashes dangerous divine energy, and even speakers of the Word dare not utter it in a voice louder than a whisper. </p><p><b>SPEAKER OF THE WORD PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Influencing Syllable (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain a +2 bonus to Charisma-based skill checks. </p><p><b>Speaker's Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can also reroll one die you roll during the same turn for an attack roll, a damage roll, a skill check, or a saving throw and use either result. </p><p><b>Empowering Syllable (16th level)</b></p><p>After you use a speaker of the Word power, you gain a +2 power bonus to attack rolls until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>SPEAKER OF THE WORD POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.9LAY5yRxbWZEqBQc]{Speaker of the Word 11-Syllable of Light}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.hRGQIax0Nb95oLve]{Speaker of the Word 12-Guiding Syllable}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.MjdOs5nC60c1XzhP]{Speaker of the Word 20-The Word Spoken}</p><p>Published in Divine Power, page(s) 76. </p>",
