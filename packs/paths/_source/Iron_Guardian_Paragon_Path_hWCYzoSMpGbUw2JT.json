			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Battlemind </p><p>The mind is more powerful than the body, and none demonstrate this principle better than you. As an iron guardian, you have learned to channel psionic energy into your flesh and bones. With a thought, your skin becomes as hard as iron and your bones become as unbreakable as stone. In battle you're a juggernaut, capable of withstanding the fiercest attacks and replying with shattering strikes of your own. </p><p>Your unmatched endurance allows you to stand at the forefront of any battle. You exult in the look of despair that crosses your enemy's face as blade, arrow, and claw rebound harmlessly off you. With this confidence, you move to the center of any fight, daring your foes to match themselves against you. </p><p><b>IRON GUARDIAN PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Indomitable Iron (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you gain a +4 bonus to AC and damage rolls until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Iron Control (11th level)</b></p><p>When any enemy pulls or pushes you, you can use a free action to slide that enemy 2 squares after the forced movement. </p><p><b>Paragon Power Points (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain 2 additional power points. </p><p><b>Impenetrable Iron (16th level)</b></p><p>Whenever a critical hit is scored against you, roll a d20. On a roll of 10 or higher, the critical hit is a normal hit instead. </p><p><b>IRON GUARDIAN POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.S7BVvuZUmMeJCd2c]{Iron Guardian 11-Guardian's Might}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.Rm79nNQTLji5ZG2w]{Iron Guardian 12-Iron Defense}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.VP8tHWqgeKdMxS31]{Iron Guardian 20-Aspect of the Iron Guardian}</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 59. </p>",
