			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warlord, Adamant Arrow Student feat </p><p>In combat after combat, you have proved that the arrow is among the deadliest of weapons. As you have grown as an archer, you have learned that a band of heroes is like an arrow. To be effective, it needs both a sharp head to guide it and a strong arm to set it in motion, both of which you provide. </p><p>Although you value mobility over heavy armor, your physical prowess means that you excel in melee. You try not to get lost in the thick of battle, because you might miss opportunities to bring your keen mind into play. You prefer to survey the battlefield with a glance and direct your allies to strike where an enemy force is weakest. If no such gap in your enemies' defenses exists, you unleash an arrow to create one. </p><p><b>ARROWHEAD COMMANDER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Nowhere to Run (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you use a ranged attack to pull, push, or slide an enemy into or out of a square adjacent to one of your allies, that ally gains a +2 bonus to attack rolls against that enemy until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Seeking Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to make an attack, any ally who can see you ignores cover and concealment until the end of your next turn when attacking the same target. </p><p><b>Tactical Adept (16th level)</b></p><p>You increase the number of squares your ranged attacks push enemies by 2. </p><p><b>ARROWHEAD COMMANDER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.dKC75zhQeiUZlj4B]{Arrowhead Commander 11-Line of Fire}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.stAXKYNI7vqJVeo9]{Arrowhead Commander 12-Strike Here}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.EjtLmZnIFsuSJ1A3]{Arrowhead Commander 20-Follow Through}</p><p>Published in Martial Power 2, page(s) 98. </p>",
