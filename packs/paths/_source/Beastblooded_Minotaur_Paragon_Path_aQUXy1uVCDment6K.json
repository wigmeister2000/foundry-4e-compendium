			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Minotaur </p><p>The fury of Baphomet is at the root of your people's creation. His demonic rage is still connected to you and yours, giving strength. In your line of work, the allure of increased might is a temptation too great to resist. You learned to tap hatred and wrath to lay your enemies low. Fury is your friend when steel rings, and the cries of the wounded and dying fill the air. The grim majesty of combat quickens your minotaur soul. What began as your hesitant step in the direction of savagery has become a full run toward your inner beast. You refuse to pay homage to Baphomet, but you don't turn away from his gifts. Why should you, when you can use the demon lord's own weapons against him? Still, the desire to kill sometimes threatens to overwhelm you. Your body ripples with power, and you become more beastly as time passes. Should you question the wisdom of your decision? </p><p><b>BEASTBLOODED MINOTAUR PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Beastly Action (11th level)</b></p><p>Immediately after you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can charge as a free action. </p><p><b>Bloodied Outburst (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you are first bloodied in an encounter, you can make a melee basic attack against an adjacent enemy as a free action. </p><p><b>Savage Apotheosis (16th level)</b></p><p>Your speed increases by 2 and your reach increases by 1. </p><p><b>BEASTBLOODED MINOTAUR POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.ZlfdxteKgjDS16JI]{Beastblooded Minotaur 11-Sweeping Gore}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.Y54sLZzTdtyCp8wE]{Beastblooded Minotaur 12-Thrashing Horns}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.KPF3id2WlzbLIZsm]{Beastblooded Minotaur 20-Giant's Sweep}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 369, page(s) 10. </p>",
