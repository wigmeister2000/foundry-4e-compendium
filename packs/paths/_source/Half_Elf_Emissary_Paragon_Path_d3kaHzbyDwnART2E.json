			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Half-elf, bard </p><p>You hate to be tied to any one location for too long; you'd rather be on the road, meeting new creatures and seeing new lands and nations. As a result, you feel at home nearly anywhere. This same ability also puts you in the good graces of people you meet along the way. </p><p>Your inborn empathy and acquired diplomatic skill allow you to fit into nearly any society-if not as someone who has always lived there, then at least as a trusted friend. By understanding many kinds of people and creatures, you learn how to protect them-or fight them, if need be. </p><p>When things turn rough, you can use your knowledge of other creatures to your advantage in a fight. The more foes that try to stop you, the better you can tangle their swords and spells, confounding their attempts to hurt you. </p><p><b>HALF-ELF EMISSARY PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Skilled Speech (11th level)</b></p><p>Your bonus to Diplomacy checks from your Group Diplomacy racial trait equals your Charisma modifier. In addition, allies within 10 squares of you apply this bonus to all checks with Charisma-based skills in which you are trained. </p><p><b>Valorous Action (Half-Elf Emissary) (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you also gain a +2 power bonus to attack rolls until the end of your next turn. If at least one bloodied ally is within 5 squares of you when you spend the action point, the bonus increases to +4. </p><p><b>Heal the Besieged (16th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you use a bard healing power on an ally, increase the number of hit points regained by 1d6 for each enemy that is adjacent to that ally. </p><p><b>HALF-ELF EMISSARY POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.RtlFI1PTL5heKUvW]{Half-Elf Emissary 11-Emissary's Onslaught}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.NIft7lPYiZg2SedQ]{Half-Elf Emissary 12-Emissary's Gambit}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.NTYteFM6sObHxGWk]{Half-Elf Emissary 20-Army of the Emissary}</p><p>Published in Arcane Power, page(s) 21. </p>",
