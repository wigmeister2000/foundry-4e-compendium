Shapechangers and aberrants hide in plain sight, concealing their hideous appearances and horrible agendas behind pleasant masks. </p><p>Mortals must be warned against this growing corruption must be shown their errors so they can repent and offer prayers and strength to the gods. And if they don't listen and don't submit to your divine missive, then it falls to you and your allies to contain their disbelief by whatever means are necessary. </p><p><b>ZEALOUS DEMAGOGUE PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Captivating Presence (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain a +2 bonus to Diplomacy, Insight, and Intimidate checks.
