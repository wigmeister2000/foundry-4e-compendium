			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Cleric </p><p>In times long past, when the gods warred with the primordials, the divine armies were arrayed in majestic regalia blessed by angelic armorers with powerful wards against their foes. By long study of holy texts, you have learned those ancient prayers and rites. </p><p>As an anointed champion, you ward yourself against your foes by sanctifying the arms and armor you bear into battle with sacred oil and special ceremonies. You speak prayers that have not been heard by mortals for centuries, conferring the ancient blessings upon your companions as well. As you perform your holy tasks, you can feel the pull of history urging you on to the same glory the armies of the gods knew as they bested their enemies in ages past. </p><p><b>ANOINTED CHAMPION PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Anointed Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you also gain a bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls equal to your Charisma modifier. The bonus lasts until the end of your turn. </p><p><b>Anointed Regalia (11th level)</b></p><p>You can choose to anoint one item you wear or carry. Doing so confers a benefit based on the item. Only one item can be anointed at a time, and the benefit lasts until you anoint a new item. As a free action, you can anoint a different item or choose a different benefit (if the anointed item is a weapon) during a short rest or after you use an anointed champion power. </p><p>Anointed Armor: You gain a +1 bonus to AC. </p><p>Anointed Weapon: You gain resistance equal to your Charisma modifier against a damage type of your choice: fire, necrotic, radiant, or thunder. </p><p>Anointed Amulet: You gain a +1 bonus to Fortitude, Reflex, and Will. </p><p><b>Additional Anointed Regalia (16th level)</b></p><p>Your Anointed Regalia path feature includes two additional types of items. </p><p>Anointed Holy Symbol: When you hit with a divine attack, you grant temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier to yourself or to an ally within your line of sight. </p><p>Anointed Helm: You gain a +2 bonus to saving throws. </p><p><b>ANOINTED CHAMPION POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.ZsiyAQwY1dkSDplR]{Anointed Champion 11-Blessed Blade}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.AOmX9DTn51sk6WS2]{Anointed Champion 12-Exaltation}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.VyNaYB3cGp0Cg1vZ]{Anointed Champion 20-Anointed Army}</p><p>Published in Divine Power, page(s) 44. </p>",
