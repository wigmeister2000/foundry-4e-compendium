			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Barbarian, Whirling Slayer class feature </p><p>Your prowess is hardly a mystery to those who behold you. You hold a weapon in your right hand and another weapon in your left. You keep your inner self somewhat contained until battle begins. At that point, you hurl yourself against as many enemies as possible. The two weapons in your hands, projecting from your whirling arms, are the lethal claws of a great predator. The spirit pack trailing you growls with bloodlust and relishes the kill. </p><p>You cultivate the feral spirit of a great wolverine, a scytheclaw drake, an ancient tribal hero, or another vicious combatant. This spirit guides your path, finally manifesting through you when you have mastered the twinclaw berserker rage. </p><p><b>TWINCLAW SLAYER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Close Destruction (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to make an attack, you gain a bonus to its attack rolls equal to the number of enemies adjacent to you. </p><p><b>Threshing Mist (11th level)</b></p><p>When any of your attacks deals both your main weapon and offhand weapon damage to the same target, you can shift 1 square to a square adjacent to the target as a free action. </p><p><b>Bloody Price (16th level)</b></p><p>While you are wielding two melee weapons, you can reroll a missed opportunity attack once per turn and use either result. </p><p><b>TWINCLAW SLAYER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.LCGiR0KqjESc87tB]{Twinclaw Slayer 11-Twinclaw Rend}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.7k2XMq8fghumPHay]{Twinclaw Slayer 12-Dangerous Blur}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.JXxi486NbuHZdgO1]{Twinclaw Slayer 20-Twinclaw Berserker Rage}</p><p>Published in Primal Power, page(s) 30. </p>",
