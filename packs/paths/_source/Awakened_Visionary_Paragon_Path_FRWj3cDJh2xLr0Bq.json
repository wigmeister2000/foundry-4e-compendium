			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Ardent </p><p>Incursions from the Far Realm have left scars across the world throughout the ages, so that the material fabric of the mortal realm is riddled with holes and fault lines. Your psionic power has made you sensitive to the damage caused by the aberrant invasion, and it has given you a talent for using that damage to your own advantage. </p><p>The memories come to you in dreams and waking visions, instructing you in forgotten fighting techniques to better combat the invasion from the Outside. These revelations also grant you a unique perspective on the world, allowing you to seek hidden pathways through time and space. Through these unseen scars of ancient battles, you move from place to place in a flash and can open portals through which you scatter your enemies across the battlefield. The more destruction caused by the threat of the Far Realm, the more powerful you become. Most importantly, this knowledge also tells you that the aberrant menace will one day be defeated. </p><p><b>AWAKENED VISIONARY PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Dimensional Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to make an attack, you can teleport a number of squares equal to your Wisdom modifier before or after the attack. </p><p><b>Paragon Power Points (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain 2 additional power points. </p><p><b>Unnerving Vision (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you hit an enemy with an unaugmented ardent at-will power, you mark that enemy until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Instant Adjustment (16th level)</b></p><p>Whenever an enemy marked by you ends its turn in a square adjacent to you, you can teleport the enemy to any other unoccupied square adjacent to you as a free action. </p><p><b>AWAKENED VISIONARY POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.O8SnDvdECzkhcf40]{Awakened Visionary 11-Yawning Portals}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.gEHtsBUXlbIwvSMx]{Awakened Visionary 12-Clear Horizon}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.RkN2LbSCFoljagHs]{Awakened Visionary 20-Warping Landscape}</p><p>Published in Psionic Power, page(s) 23. </p>",
