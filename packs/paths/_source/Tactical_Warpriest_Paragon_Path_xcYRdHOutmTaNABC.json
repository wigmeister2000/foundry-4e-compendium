			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Cleric </p><p>Your god demands battle to accomplish the tenets of your faith, and you are the chosen priest at the forefront of the war. When you call upon your divine powers, your weapons glow with holy light. </p><p><b>TACTICAL WARPRIEST PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Extra Damage Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you gain a power bonus to the damage rolls of your standard action attacks this turn. The bonus equals one-half your level. </p><p><b>Warpriest's Strategy (11th level)</b></p><p>Once per encounter, if you or an adjacent ally rolls a 1 when making a melee attack or a close attack, you can call for a reroll. </p><p><b>Warpriest's Training (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing heavy armor. </p><p><b>Warpriest's Challenge (16th level)</b></p><p>When you hit an enemy with an at-will melee attack, you can choose to mark that enemy for the rest of the encounter. The next time that enemy shifts or attacks a creature other than you while the enemy is adjacent to you, you can make an opportunity attack against the enemy. If you mark a new enemy with this feature, any previous mark you have made with this feature ends. </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 74, Class Compendium. </p>",
