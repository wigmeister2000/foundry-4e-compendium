			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Barbarian, Thunderborn Wrath class feature </p><p>As you have grown in power, the thunder spirits riding on your war cries have amassed strength of their own. When your weapon strikes true, the spirits pour from you in an unrivaled storm, smashing enemies who might have shrugged off your physical blows or the war cries of a lesser thunderborn barbarian. </p><p>Like a great storm piling thunderheads higher and darker, you gather strength as you fight battles and suffer wounds. More conservative warriors hold back or retreat when their wounds accumulate, whereas you reach your peak when your reserves are close to their end. </p><p>When the storm finally breaks, your voice calls the lightning as well as the thunder spirits. You master the full arsenal of the storm. </p><p><b>BUILDING THUNDER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Thunder Rolls In (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to use a thunder power, you can turn any blast 3 created by that power into a blast 5. </p><p><b>Thunderous Echo (11th level)</b></p><p>When you hit an enemy with a thunder power, you deal extra thunder damage equal to your Constitution modifier to the first creature you hit before the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Lightning Flash (16th level)</b></p><p>Your thunder powers deal lightning and thunder damage when they deal thunder damage. </p><p><b>BUILDING THUNDER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.5rLpjO0GKcagWfHy]{Building Thunder 11-Finishing Thunder}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.8CFf6MSawcUsKRNQ]{Building Thunder 12-Storm Gathering}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.BunwKIxCD8tO471V]{Building Thunder 20-Storm Dragon Rage}</p><p>Published in Primal Power, page(s) 26. </p>",
