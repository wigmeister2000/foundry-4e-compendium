			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Ranger, Reaving Axe Student feat </p><p>You have grown up on the edge of society, living a life that forced you to perform deeds you want to forget. Combat was not a choice but a means of survival. You might have once been a pirate or a highway brigand. Now, you turn your talents against any that remind you of the monster you used to be. You bring the fight to your foe and don't discriminate against opponents. An enemy is an enemy, from a simple cutthroat to the vilest warlord. </p><p>You don't consider it your job to protect the weak and innocent; plenty of others accept that role. Your expertise is in understanding the ways of scoundrels and raiders, for their methods were once your own. You don't follow a lofty code or care how others see you-you fight dirty, and it suits you. </p><p>Your fight is with pirates that raid fishing villages, criminal organizations that collect protection money, or invading bands of drow that seek slaves for their Underdark homes. You need no rank and have no desire to be limited by any hierarchy. Interference from government slows down what you need to do. You might not be a traditional hero, but you fight traditional villains. </p><p><b>REAVING AXE SAVANT PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Raider's Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can make a basic attack as a free action against one creature that is prone, slowed, immobilized, or restrained before or after the extra action. </p><p><b>Unfair Advantage (Reaving Axe Savant) (11th level)</b></p><p><b>Turn the Tables (16th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you save against an effect, your quarry grants combat advantage until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>REAVING AXE SAVANT POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.dPRmDNpyXfZsWE7U]{Reaving Axe Savant 11-Raider's War Cry}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.DO7rpfgId53uHBtx]{Reaving Axe Savant 12-Dread Quarry}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.PMS1z2BtmTxnkiO0]{Reaving Axe Savant 20-Cheap Shot}</p><p>Published in Martial Power 2, page(s) 51. </p>",
