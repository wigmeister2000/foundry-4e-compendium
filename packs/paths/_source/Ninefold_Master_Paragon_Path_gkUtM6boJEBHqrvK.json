			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Dragonborn, any arcane class, Draconic Spellcaster. </p><p>In ancient Arkhosia, arcane spellcasters studied the Ninefold Path, a way toward both arcane mastery and spiritual awakening. The steps along the path represent an increasing attunement to the draconic energies in the initiate's being, a practice that unites the study of magic with the innate characteristics of the dragonborn race. </p><p>You are a master of the Ninefold Path, on your way toward arcane perfection as the scholars of Arkhosia understood it. Your dragon breath is another spell in your arsenal, and when you use spells that create the same elemental force as your breath, you demonstrate mastery over the magic that powers them. </p><p><b>NINEFOLD MASTER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Breath Expertise (11th level)</b></p><p>Your dragon breath power is considered an arcane power belonging to each of your arcane classes. If you are wielding an implement you can use for your arcane powers, you may add the implement's enhancement bonus to the damage rolls for your dragon breath power. </p><p><b>Dragon Breath Action (Ninefold Master) (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can also use your dragon breath power as a free action, even if you have already expended it in this encounter. </p><p><b>Draconic Resistance (16th level)</b></p><p>Choose one damage type you can deal with your dragon breath power. You gain resistance to that damage type equal to 5 + one-half your level. </p><p><b>NINEFOLD MASTER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.IZrluQthOSCFsEY1]{Ninefold Master 11-Dragon Aura}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.xY1rQBTgf0tL8wah]{Ninefold Master 12-Countering Breath}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.rixPBlGWgzVRoyht]{Ninefold Master 20-Dragon Tempest}</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook Races: Dragonborn, page(s) 12. </p>",
