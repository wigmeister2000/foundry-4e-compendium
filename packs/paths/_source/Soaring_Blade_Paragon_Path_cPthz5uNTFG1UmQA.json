			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Monk, trained in Acrobatics </p><p>Battle is not just a physical contest-it is a spectacle, a dance of parries and thrusts, of slashes and ripostes. True mastery of the blade adds soaring form and motion, transporting the struggle into aerial art. </p><p>What sets you apart from earthbound combatants is your melding of discipline and precise swordplay. Your training and your psionic power grant you incredible mobility; your focus hones your edge. </p><p><b>SOARING BLADE PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Focused Parry Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to make an attack and the attack hits, you gain a bonus to all defenses equal to your Constitution modifier until you make an attack or until the end of the encounter. </p><p><b>Soaring Blade Style (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain a +3 bonus to Acrobatics checks. In addition, when you would make an Athletics check to climb or jump, you can make an Acrobatics check instead. </p><p><b>Soaring Blade Training (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain proficiency with all simple and military heavy blades. You can utilize a heavy blade for any monk power usable with a light blade. </p><p><b>Ki Blade (16th level)</b></p><p>You channel psionic energy through your heavy blade. After each extended rest, choose a damage type: cold, fire, or lightning. Your melee attacks using a heavy blade deal extra damage of that type equal to your Constitution modifier. In addition, when you score a critical hit using a heavy blade, the attack deals 2d10 extra damage of that type. </p><p>Published in Psionic Power, page(s) 76. </p>",
