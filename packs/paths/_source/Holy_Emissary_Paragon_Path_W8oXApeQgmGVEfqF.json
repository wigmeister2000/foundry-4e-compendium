			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Cleric </p><p>You are a herald of the gods, imbued with divine will. Wherever you travel, you announce the intentions and desires of your patron. Your actions, words, and beliefs are windows into the gods' dominions, and through them shines the divine presence. </p><p>Although you serve a single deity, you enjoy a special connection with all divine powers, allowing them to subtly influence you and those around you. You might even be moved to prophesy from time to time. Some devotees of your faith might distrust this relationship; although they too honor all the gods, they take pride in their service to a single deity. </p><p>Whenever you speak in Supernal or utter your prayers, a tongue of fire appears over your head. The flame does not burn and sheds only the faintest light, but it does identify your special status. </p><p><b>HOLY EMISSARY PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Gift of Grace Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, each ally adjacent to you also gains a bonus to all defenses equal to your Charisma modifier until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Gift of Hope (11th level)</b></p><p>Any ally who ends his or her turn adjacent to you gains a +2 bonus to saving throws until the start of his or her next turn. </p><p><b>Holy Tongue (11th level)</b></p><p>You are fluent in Supernal. </p><p><b>Gift of Life (16th level)</b></p><p>When you restore hit points to a bloodied target by using a divine healing power, the target regains 1d6 additional hit points. </p><p>Published in Divine Power, page(s) 48. </p>",
