			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Channel Divinity class feature, proficiency with a bow, must worship Sehanine </p><p>Under the cloak of night, tyrants and murderers grow restless. They sense an intent gaze upon them, like a bird of prey circling in for the kill. Sometimes this unease is enough to discourage despicable acts. But far too often, a more direct course of action needs to be taken, and the silvered head of an arrow puts down evil. </p><p>The Arrows of the Moonbow are a scattered sect of sworn brothers and sisters who dedicate their lives to ensuring that each mortal has a fair chance at writing his or her own destiny and changing his or her own stars. The Arrows travel far and wide, seeking no reward but that which they confiscate from the corpses of their targets. All sorts of divine heroes work among their ranks but, regardless of inclination, they all come to favor subterfuge, trickery and, above all, stealth. </p><p><b>ARROW OF THE MOONBOW PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Moonkissed Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to make an attack using a bow, you can roll one attack roll twice and take either result. </p><p><b>Walker in Twilight (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain training in Stealth and also gain low-light vision. If you already have training in Stealth, you gain the Skill Focus feat for Stealth. </p><p><b>Break the Bonds (16th level)</b></p><p>You gain the break the bonds Channel Divinity power. </p><p><b>ARROW OF THE MOONBOW POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.IExAwUnN1b7J6umZ]{Arrow of the Moonbow 11-Three Moonbeams}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.0mbSI6wO1fhc2VLx]{Arrow of the Moonbow 12-Moon Eye}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.R07pyDUcqekGP6MH]{Arrow of the Moonbow 20-Moon Shot}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 386, page(s) 70. </p>",
