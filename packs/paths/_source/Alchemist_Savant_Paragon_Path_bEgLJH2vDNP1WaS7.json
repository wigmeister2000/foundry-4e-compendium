From an alchemist's laboratory, all manner of fantastic creations are born-from poisons to potions to fantastic devices. </p><p>As an alchemist savant, you transcend the skill of hedge wizards. You blend magic with alchemical compounds. By combining mystic energy with your recipes, you produce deadly concoctions that can rival any weapon. </p><p><b>ALCHEMIST SAVANT PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Alchemical Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to make an attack with an alchemical item, you gain a bonus to the attack roll equal to your Intelligence modifier. </p><p><b>Alchemical Innovator (11th level)</b></p><p>At 11th level, and again at 15th, 21st, and 25th, you master two formulas of your choice. The formulas you master must be of your level or lower. </p><p><b>Resourceful Alchemist (11th level)</b></p><p>When you create new alchemical items, you can use existing alchemical items as components.
