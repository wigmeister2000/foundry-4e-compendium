			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Paladin </p><p>You have sworn a sacred vow to pursue a great quest that has challenged the devotion of divine champions for centuries. </p><p>As a questing knight, you must meet your god's demanding standards to prove yourself worthy of success. Depending on the nature of your deity, you might have to demonstrate outstanding courage, perseverance, humility, indomitability, wisdom, honor, fury, or piety. The object of the quest could be a lost relic, a hidden oracle, the words of a holy verse now forgotten, the destruction of an artifact inimical to your god, or the defeat of a legendary foe. </p><p>Because the trail leading to your ultimate goal sometimes grows cold, you need not abandon your current concerns entirely. Continue with your adventures, and strive to be the best you can be, but watch carefully for signs and portents that lead you onward in your quest. </p><p><b>QUESTING KNIGHT PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Questing Knight Resolute Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you also make a saving throw with a +2 bonus. </p><p><b>Truth Sense (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain a +2 bonus to Will against charm, fear, and illusion effects and a +2 bonus to Insight checks. </p><p><b>Knight's Resurgence (16th level)</b></p><p>While you are bloodied, you can use your second wind as a free action on your turn. </p><p><b>QUESTING KNIGHT POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.FmnVdq8ubyAQGoZY]{Questing Knight 11-Strength of Ten}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.Nym4VkLGiTnSX3og]{Questing Knight 12-Quester's Discipline}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.JRxKmwuEVN1kajSr]{Questing Knight 20-Virtuous Wrath}</p><p>Published in Divine Power, page(s) 103. </p>",
