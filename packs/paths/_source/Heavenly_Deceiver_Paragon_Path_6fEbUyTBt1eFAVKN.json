			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Deva </p><p>At 11th level, your veilwalker deva takes on the heavenly deceiver paragon path. You walk just this side of a boundary thinner than the finest veil and develop an affinity for the deceptive magic of the rakshasa even as the memories of past incarnations become distant. You choose your path to take advantage of this power and wield it against evil; or perhaps you are on a path dictated by your carelessness-because the intentionally evil would already be beyond redemption. You bear patterns on your skin distinct from those on most devas. The colors are always darker and include more red than their incorruptible brethren. The patterns made by the colorations are sharper, more sudden, and more violent than the simple elegance of other devas. </p><p>The longer you remain a veilwalker, the greater a command over illusion and deceit that balancing act grants you. Manipulation of others becomes an art and a second nature to you. </p><p><b>HEAVENLY DECEIVER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Deceitful Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you become invisible until the end of your next turn or until you make an attack. </p><p><b>Illusion-Sheathed Strike (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain the illusion-sheathed strike power. </p><p><b>Snake-Tongued Mastery (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain a +2 bonus to Bluff checks, and you gain the deceitful image power. </p><p><b>Duplicate Image (12th level)</b></p><p>You gain the duplicate image power. </p><p><b>Deceitful Terrain (16th level)</b></p><p>When you start your turn, you can use a free action to slide an adjacent enemy to another non-hindering square adjacent to you. </p><p><b>Illusion of Solitude (20th level)</b></p><p>You gain the illusion of solitude power. </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 393. </p>",
