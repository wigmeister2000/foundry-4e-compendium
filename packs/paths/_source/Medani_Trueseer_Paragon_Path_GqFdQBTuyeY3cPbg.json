In your case, the rigorous training combines with the power of your dragon mark to bring your powers of prescience and observation to supernatural levels. You can reveal invisible foes with ease and throw your enemies from their feet by anticipating their movements. As a Medani trueseer, you think a step ahead of everyone else. Even adversaries that think they've outsmarted you find themselves lured into traps that give you the advantage. </p><p><b>MEDANI TRUESEER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Blindless Sight (11th level)</b></p><p>You cannot be blinded, and you gain a +2 bonus to Perception checks and initiative checks. </p><p><b>Trueseer Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, any enemy you can see grants combat advantage to you until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Medani Targeting (16th level)</b></p><p>Your attacks ignore cover and concealment, but not superior cover and total concealment, against a target you have combat advantage against. </p><p><b>MEDANI TRUESEER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.C0rAmH25RdgDBNEw]{Medani Trueseer 11-Medani True Strike}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.SEzaBRVc1gKIO7Ar]{Medani Trueseer 12-Medani Foretelling}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.5UIZCXv7WxKT2rEl]{Medani Trueseer 20-Disruptive Premonition}</p><p>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 73. </p>",
