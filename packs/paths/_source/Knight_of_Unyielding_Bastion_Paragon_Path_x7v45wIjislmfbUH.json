			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Paladin </p><p>As protectors of civilization and the innocents who dwell therein, many paladins focus their efforts against one particular type of threat, standing fast even when all others run or fall. As a Knight of the Unyielding Bastion, you have been trained in tactics, techniques, and mystical prayers that augment your abilities against dragons. </p><p><b>KNIGHT OF UNYIELDING BASTION PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Dragon-Slayer's Action (11th level)</b></p><p>You can spend an action point to reroll an attack roll against a dragon, or to end a condition currently affecting you that originated from a dragon, and that a save can end. Using this feature replaces the normal action point benefit of taking an extra action. </p><p><b>Dragon's Challenge (11th level)</b></p><p>When you use divine challenge to mark a dragon, it takes a -4 penalty to any attack that does not include you as a target, instead of -2. When a dragon takes damage from your divine challenge, it takes additional damage equal to your Wisdom modifier. </p><p><b>Partake of My Strength (16th level)</b></p><p>You can use your lay on hands power on an ally as an immediate interrupt when you and an ally are both targeted by a close or area attack </p><p><b>KNIGHT OF UNYIELDING BASTION POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.BIOQiuq01S8bGftN]{Knight of Unyielding Bastion 11-Divine Deflection}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.KYFWH8zgocverl24]{Knight of Unyielding Bastion 12-Dragon Flame Sacrifice}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.bqNdzFgVOyAGUYMj]{Knight of Unyielding Bastion 20-Beast-Punishing Strike}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 369, page(s) 48. </p>",
