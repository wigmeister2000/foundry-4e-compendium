			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Druid </p><p>Perhaps you were raised in the wilderness and learned to summon beasts to serve as your hunting companions. Perhaps your community needed protection, and you learned the ways of summoning animal guardians at a moment's notice. Or it could be that you grew up hearing the whispers of animal spirits and are a master at calling them to your side. Whatever your route to the path of the primal summoner, you seek a mastery over summoned beasts that other druids do not possess. Some of your abilities help your beasts act on their instincts, whereas other abilities help you command those beasts with even greater skill. </p><p>The primal slayer that you learn to control at the peak of your power is an ancient spirit. It might not be the most mighty creature you learn to summon, but its ability to change its shape echoes the versatility of your power. </p><p><b>PRIMAL SUMMONER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Feral Ways (11th level)</b></p><p>When your summoned creatures use their instinctive effects, they regain hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier and gain a +2 power bonus to any attack rolls that are part of those effects. </p><p><b>Primal Summoner Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can give a single standard action command to one of your summoned creatures as a free action. </p><p><b>Move as One (16th level)</b></p><p>When you move using a move action, one of your summoned creatures can move its speed. </p><p><b>PRIMAL SUMMONER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.0qDLZIv8rSgt7YJy]{Primal Summoner 11-Redfang Prophecy}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.G4qNenCYcQofORUF]{Primal Summoner 12-Tightened Control}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.KJGIxoikv9DRFAHC]{Primal Summoner 20-Summon Primal Slayer}</p><p>Published in Primal Power, page(s) 56. </p>",
