			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Sorcerer, Dragon Magic class feature </p><p>In the early years of the world, the mightiest sorcerers were dragons, powerful spellcasters who used the elemental magic churning in their blood to create devastating spells that cemented their hold over vast empires. Even as recently as the dragonborn empire of Arkhosia, dragons were the exemplars of the draconic sorcerer's path. In the present age, however, few dragons practice the art that their ancestors created. </p><p>Your path follows in the ancient footsteps of the greatest sorcerers the world has ever known, drawing on the traditions preserved from Arkhosia's dragon lords and the sorcerers before them, back almost to the beginning of the world. Wielding the same power as the dragons of old, you inure yourself to the dangers of battle, making your mere presence a threat to your foes as you wreathe yourself in flames or lightning, acid or poison, cold or thunder, according to the nature of the draconic magic in your blood. </p><p>The dragons of old are alive in your soul, and their power is yours to command. </p><p><b>DRAGONSOUL HEIR PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Draconic Durability (11th level)</b></p><p>Your number of healing surges per day increases by two. </p><p><b>Draconic Resilience Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you also gain a number of temporary hit points equal to one-half your level. </p><p><b>Dragon Soul Resistance (16th level)</b></p><p>The resistance provided by your Dragon Soul class feature increases by 10. </p><p><b>DRAGONSOUL HEIR POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.lOLkV7mz3wIixfdc]{Dragonsoul Heir 11-Breath of the Dragon Soul}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.GwcjQoP7m4OtAy6X]{Dragonsoul Heir 12-Dragon's Revenge}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.Nur5sIPSiKMfg2cJ]{Dragonsoul Heir 20-Veil of the Dragon}</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 150. </p>",
