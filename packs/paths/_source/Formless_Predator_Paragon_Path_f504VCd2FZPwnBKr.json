			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Wild shape power </p><p>You desired more fluidity of form and motion than what the masters taught you, so you reached out to a creature you knew would grant the abilities you seek. By claiming the chaos beast as your totem creature, you can take its form, and, in doing so, the form of any shape that its aberrant mind could imagine. </p><p>Chaos beasts continually change form, and their strength comes from inf licting changes upon their unwilling foes. In taking their form, such as it is, you grow more powerful. Your body does not move like other creatures. You gain the upper hand by warping your limbs and contorting your joints in unnatural ways, leaving your enemies unable to predict your attacks. </p><p><b>FORMLESS PREDATOR PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Aberrant Form (11th level)</b></p><p>When you use wild shape to assume beast form, you can choose to resemble an aberrant creature rather than a natural beast. </p><p><b>Jagged Metamorphosis (11th level)</b></p><p>The first time you use wild shape each encounter, you gain a +4 bonus to damage rolls until the start of your next turn. </p><p><b>Reinstating Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can also end one effect on you. You may also shift 1 square before or after the extra action. </p><p><b>Fluid Form (16th level)</b></p><p>Choose a 1st-level at-will attack power that you know. That power gains the beast form keyword while you are in beast form, and loses the beast form keyword while you are in humanoid form. </p><p><b>FORMLESS PREDATOR POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.3Y2JxzM1Nuk0h6cX]{Formless Predator 11-Undulating Pseudopod}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.fXtZkrNsiROdIzQw]{Formless Predator 12-Amorphous Return}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.OBMQYymwIfUR9SiP]{Formless Predator 20-Touch of Dissolution}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 394. </p>",
