			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Seeker </p><p>Spirits are everywhere in the world, from haunted forests to windswept mountains. These entities can be nothing more than wild emotions given half-realized form or can possess vast intelligence, with memories stretching back to the world's earliest days. You turn to these spirits to help you protect the world, drawing from their vast and mysterious power to glimpse your enemies' fates and bring about their final ends. </p><p>Communing with the land's spirits reveals possible futures, from which you pluck the strands of fate that coincide best with your travels, and you weave those strands into your bowstring. Arrows fired from the bow carry with them the fates your enemies deserve. </p><p>This paragon path is one of guardianship. Just as you can harry enemies by loosing spirits at them, so too can you alter the fates of those around you. These techniques help keep your allies from harm, even as you frustrate and confound your foes. </p><p><b>SEVEN FATES ARCHER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Guarding Shot (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you make a ranged attack, you can take a -2 penalty to the attack roll against one of the targets to grant a +2 bonus to the AC of one ally adjacent to that target. The bonus lasts until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Pinning Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to make a ranged basic attack, targets hit by the attack are also immobilized and grant combat advantage until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Opportunity Shot (16th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you can make an opportunity attack, you can make a ranged basic attack in place of a melee basic attack. Your attack doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. </p><p><b>SEVEN FATES ARCHER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.rAhgXaczSvKmnYy1]{Seven Fates Archer 11-Spirit Shackles}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.RWBY29ZqEgIcsikj]{Seven Fates Archer 12-Intercepting Shot}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.BFZUfQsGR0ctjDhz]{Seven Fates Archer 20-Storm of Five Spirits}</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 132. </p>",
