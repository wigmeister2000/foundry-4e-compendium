Even if the attack is shaken off, the target feels the lingering effect of the psychic corruption these creatures inflict.</em></p>\n<p class=\"powerstat\"><strong>Stage 0</strong>: The target recovers from the disease.<br><strong>Stage 1</strong>: Initial Effect: The target takes a -4 penalty to Will.<br><strong>Stage 2</strong>: The target grants combat advantage.<br><strong>Stage 3</strong>: Final State: Unless prevented from doing so, the target moves toward the lair of the meenlocks that infected it. Treat the target as dominated by meenlocks until the disease is cured.<br><strong>Check</strong>: At the end of each extended rest, the target makes an Insight check if it is at stage 1 or 2.<br><em>14 or lower</em>: The stage of the disease increases by one.<br><em>15-19</em>: No Change<br><em>20 or higher</em>: The stage of the disease decreases by one.</p>\n<p class=\"publishedIn\">Published in Monster Manual 3, page(s) 133, Dungeon Magazine 190.</p>",
