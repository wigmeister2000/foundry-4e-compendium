The werewolf 's bite exposes targets to this curse, rather than werewolf moon frenzy.<br><strong>Check</strong>: At the end of each extended rest, the target makes a Nature check if it is at stage 1, 2, or 3.<br><em>11 or lower</em>: The stage of the disease increases by one.<br><em>12-15</em>: No Change<br><em>16 or higher</em>: The stage of the disease decreases by one.<br><strong>Special:</strong> Lifting the Curse: Bestow the curse on one good creature of your level or higher.
