He is not mentioned in the Player's Handbook or named in the Monster Manual, because the fact of his existence is not widely known. A few scattered cults of demented followers revere him, calling him the Chained God or the Elder Elemental Eye. Tharizdun doesn't speak to his followers, so his commands are unknown, but his cults teach their members to: </p><p>- Channel power to the Chained God, so he can break his chains. </p><p>- Retrieve lost relics and shrines to the Chained God. </p><p>- Pursue the obliteration of the world, in anticipation of the Chained God's liberation. </p><p>Published in Dungeon Master's Guide, page(s) 163. </p>",
