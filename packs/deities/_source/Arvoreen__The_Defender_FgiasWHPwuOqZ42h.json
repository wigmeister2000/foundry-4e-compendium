The inherent wanderlust of the hin grants them little patience for the long marches and dull waiting between battles that characterizes most warfare. However, when invaders threaten a halfling community, residents send prayers to Arvoreen, whose worshipers follow a doctrine of guardianship, stern defense, and aggressive watchfulness. </p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81. </p>",
