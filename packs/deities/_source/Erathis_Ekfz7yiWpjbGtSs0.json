She is the muse of great invention, founder of cities, and author of laws. Rulers, judges, pioneers, and devoted citizens revere her, and her temples hold prominent places in most of the world's major cities. Her laws are many, but their purpose is straightforward: </p><p>* Work with others to achieve your goals. Community and order are always stronger than the disjointed efforts of lone individuals. </p><p>* Tame the wilderness to make it fit for habitation and defend the light of civilization against the encroaching darkness. </p><p>* Seek out new ideas, new inventions, new lands to inhabit, new wilderness to conquer. Build machines, build cities, build empires. </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 21, Heroes of the Fallen Lands, page(s) 50. </p>",
