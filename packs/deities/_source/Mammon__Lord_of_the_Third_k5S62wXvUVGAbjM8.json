In form, he resembles a 30-foot-long serpent with a human torso, head, and arms. He wields a harpoonlike spear, though its magic is the least of Mammon's impressive abilities. Mammon is a turncoat's turncoat. Though he once allied with Dispater and Mephistopheles against Asmodeus, he was the first to abase himself before the Lord of the Ninth when Asmodeus finally proved victorious at the close of a failed rebellion called the Reckoning. Few of the other Lords would ever trust Mammon again. </p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81. </p>",
