The target loses this healing surge again if its condition worsens.<br><strong>Stage 2</strong>: Initial Effect: The target loses two healing surges until cured.<br><strong>Stage 3</strong>: Each time the target becomes bloodied, it takes ongoing 10 necrotic damage (save ends). If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it turns into infectious slime from the inside out, dying horribly.<br><strong>Stage 4</strong>: Final State: At the moment of the failed Endurance check and each time the target takes damage, the character takes ongoing 30 necrotic damage (save ends). If this damage reduces the character to 0 hit points, it turns into infectious slime from the inside out, dying horribly.<br><strong>Check</strong>: At the end of each extended rest, the target makes an Endurance check if it is at stage 1, 2, or 3.<br><em>24 or lower</em>: The stage of the disease increases by one.<br><em>25-29</em>: No Change<br><em>30 or higher</em>: The stage of the disease decreases by one.</p>\n<p class=\"publishedIn\">Published in Dungeon Master's Guide, page(s) 50.</p>",
