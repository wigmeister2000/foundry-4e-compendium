He commands them to: </p><p>Never reveal all you know. </p><p>Find the seed of darkness in your heart and nourish it; find it in others and exploit it to your advantage. </p><p>Oppose the followers of all other deities so that Vecna alone can rule the world. </p><p>Published in Dungeon Master's Guide, page(s) 163. </p>",
