Bel betrayed the former Lord of the First, Zariel, for his current position. While Bel has succeeded where many failed before him, his climb to power seems to be stalled now, since he does not enjoy the support of other Lords of the Nine, except for possibly Asmodeus. </p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81. </p>",
