He revels in strength, battlefield prowess, and thunder. Fighters and athletes revere him. He is a mercurial god, unbridled and wild, who summons storms over land and sea; those who hope for better weather appease him with prayers and spirited toasts. He gives few commands: </p><p>* Be strong, but do not use your strength for wanton destruction. </p><p>* Be brave and scorn cowardice in any form. </p><p>* Prove your might in battle to win glory and renown. </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 22, Heroes of the Fallen Lands, page(s) 51. </p>",
