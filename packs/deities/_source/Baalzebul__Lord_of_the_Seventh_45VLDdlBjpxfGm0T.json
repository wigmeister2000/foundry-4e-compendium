The patron of strength and guile, he is commonly worshiped by bugbears, though many human cults revere him as well. Baalzebul looks like a massive slug with tiny, malformed arms and a grotesque, twisted face perched atop a bloated, glistening body. </p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81. </p>",
