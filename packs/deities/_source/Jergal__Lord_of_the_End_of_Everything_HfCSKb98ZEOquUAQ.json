Both bland and excessively formal, he never angers and always speaks with a disembodied, chilling voice that echoes with the dry whisper of a long forsaken crypt. The Lord of the End of Everything stives only for an orderly accounting of the fate of the world as it slowly sinks into death. </p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81. </p>",
