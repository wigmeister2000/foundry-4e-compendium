He seeded the world with arcane magic and planted the most ancient forests. Artists and musicians worship him, as do those who view their spellcasting as an art, and his shrines can be found throughout the Feywild. He despises Lolth and her priestesses for leading the drow astray. He urges his followers to: </p><p>* Cultivate beauty in all that you do, whether you're casting a spell, composing a saga, strumming a lute, or practicing the arts of war. </p><p>* Seek out lost magic items, forgotten rituals, and ancient works of art. Corellon might have inspired them in the world's first days. </p><p>* Thwart the followers of Lolth at every opportunity. </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 21, Heroes of the Fallen Lands, page(s) 50. </p>",
