Venerated by humans and gnomes (who know him as Nebelun) alike, Gond transforms ideas into concrete form and inspires mortals to make new things. He cares only for the act of creation, paying little heed to the consequences of letting loose his inventions into the world. </p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 80. </p>",
