Where she walks, misfortune and death follow. She has the personailty of a petulant, greedy child trapped in the body of a once-beautiful woman now scarred by horrific disease and ravaged by age. She alternately desires attention at any cost like a small child and becomes aloof like a wounded paramour who has been discarded by her love. </p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 80. </p>",
