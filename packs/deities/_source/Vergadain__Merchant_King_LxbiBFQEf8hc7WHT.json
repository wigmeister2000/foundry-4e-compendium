Those who pay attention, however, know that the Merchant King has an aspect that, if not darker, seldom fills more legal-minded dwarves with pride. As a patron of luck and trickery, Vergadain also oversees those dwarves who use illicit means to gain their wealth. </p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81. </p>",
