She is both the wild beast and the peaceful forest, the raging whirlpool and the quiet desert. Rangers, hunters, and elves revere her, and sailors make offerings to her before beginning their voyages. Her strictures are these: </p><p>* Protect the wild places of the world from destruction and overuse. Oppose the rampant spread of cities and empires. </p><p>* Hunt aberrant monsters and other abominations of nature. </p><p>* Do not fear or condemn the savagery of nature. Live in harmony with the wild. </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 22, Heroes of the Fallen Lands, page(s) 52. </p>",
