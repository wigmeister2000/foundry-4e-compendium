			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>God </p><p><b>Alignment: </b>Good </p><p><b>Gender: </b>Female </p><p><b>Domain: </b>Change, Freedom, Luck </p><p>The god of change, Avandra delights in freedom, trade, travel, adventure, and the frontier. Her temples are few in civilized lands, but her wayside shrines appear throughout the world. Halflings, merchants, and all types of adventurers are drawn to her worship, and many people raise a glass in her honor, viewing her as the god of luck. Her commandments are few: </p><p>* Luck favors the bold. Take your fate into your own hands, and Avandra smiles upon you. </p><p>* Strike back against those who would rob you of your freedom and urge others to fight for their own liberty. </p><p>* Change is inevitable, but it takes the work of the faithful to ensure that change is for the better. </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 21, Heroes of the Fallen Lands, page(s) 49. </p>",
