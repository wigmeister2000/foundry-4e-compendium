She holds sway not so much over the natural world, but over the way in which sentient mortals interact with the world. </p><p>The Great Mother is revered by any who depend on the land for their livelihood. A kindly mistress, she ensures healthy harvests to those who treat the tilled earth with the respect she demands. </p><p>Chauntean priests pray to the Great Mother at sunset. For her favor, she asks that her faithful spend every effort preserving the natural cycle of growth and harvest. The devoted are divided into two sects: the pastorals, who minister to farmers and villagers, and the true shapers, solitary druids who find truth in the wild lands yet to be tamed. </p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 73. </p>",
