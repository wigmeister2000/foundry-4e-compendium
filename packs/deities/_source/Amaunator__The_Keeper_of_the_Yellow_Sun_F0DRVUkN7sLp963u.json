Though some say he died, he actually transformed into Lathander, and was worshiped under that name for centuries before finally reclaiming both his name and his mission. He causes the sun to burn and sets its course across the sky, giving rise to the celestial clock by which all time is measured. </p><p>All who benefit from the accurate keeping of clocks and calendars-such as farmers, merchants, and nomads who follow the seasons-revere Amaunator. He is also favored by those mortals who respect the law and find comfort in predictability. </p><p>Amaunatori are rigid and traditional in the worship of their deity, and little variety exists between different sects. His priests, the sunlords, offer their services as judges and administrators. Their most solemn observances are reserved for the day of the summer solstice. </p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 72. </p>",
