Glasya is a sadist who loves watching her victims suffer as disease and strange growths sweep through their bodies. She has a disturbing love for beauty, and spares those she finds appealing. She is quick to dominate her opponents to teach them the error of their ways. The other Lords fear her, suspecting Glasya's takeover of Malbolge as a bid to consolidate Asmodeus's control over the Nine Hells. </p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81. </p>",
