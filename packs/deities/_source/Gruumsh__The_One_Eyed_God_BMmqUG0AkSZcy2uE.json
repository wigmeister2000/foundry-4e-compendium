Where Bane commands conquest, Gruumsh exhorts his followers to slaughter and pillage. Orcs are his fervent followers, and they bear a particular hatred for elves and eladrin because Corellon put out one of Gruumsh's eyes. The One-Eyed God gives simple orders to his followers: </p><p>- Conquer and destroy. </p><p>- Let your strength crush the weak. </p><p>- Do as you will, and let no one stop you. </p><p>Published in Dungeon Master's Guide, page(s) 162. </p>",
