Although he is slow to anger, the wrath of the Broken Deity is terrible in the face of extreme cruelty or atrocities. He takes great care to reassure and protect children and young creatures, and he takes exceptional offense at those who would harm them. </p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 80. </p>",
