She encouraged camaraderie among her subjects, always with an eye toward ensuring the safety of each halfling's individual dwelling. Of late, however, she has expanded her view of home from the literal to the metaphorical, believing that the time of the halfling is now, and that in order for the hin to ascend to their rightful place of honor and respect, the race needs new homelands beyond the borders of Luiren. </p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81. </p>",
