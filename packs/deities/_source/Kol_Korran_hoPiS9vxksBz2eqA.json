In the postwar world, where trade is cautiously emerging and expanding, his following is on the rise. Merchants, traders, and thieves are his primary Vassals, but anyone who has money, or wants more, pays him homage. Religious texts say he and his twin brother the Keeper are the sons of Olladra and Onatar. These same books depict him as a plump, cheerful human or dwarf in fine clothes. A few ancient depictions show him as a white dragon atop a bed of ice-blue gemstones. </p><p>He teaches his worshipers to: </p><p>- Acquire wealth. </p><p>- Travel. New lands offer new trading partners to cultivate and new resources to gather. </p><p>- Remember that a charming smile and a kind word are often more powerful than a blade and a strong arm. </p><p>Kol Korran is part of the The Sovereign Host, a group of deities collectively representing the entire world, but focusing on aspects of civilization-community, the protection of the weak, the slaying of wild beasts, fertility, construction, and the like. The Sovereign Host is the most widely worshiped body in Khorvaire. Nearly everyone offers prayers to the Host as a whole and to individual deities for specific actions. For example, a farmer might whisper a prayer of thanks to Arawai when his baby is born healthy, and a blacksmith might sing the songs of Onatar when working at her forge. The Sovereign Host finds worshipers among all races and from all walks of life-peasants, kings, and adventurers. The faithful worship the pantheon as a whole, rather than devoting themselves to specific deities. Worshipers of the Sovereign Host are called Vassals. </p><p>As a group, the Host exhorts its followers to: </p><p>-Place your trust in the community. The group is stronger by far than the individual. The great light of a city is composed of the thousands of flames of its citizens. You must ensure that your flame is as bright as you can make it. </p><p>- Treat others as they deserve to be treated. If they haven't harmed you or yours, treat them kindly. </p><p>- Bring the light of civilization to the darkness of the wilds. </p><p>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 16. </p>",
