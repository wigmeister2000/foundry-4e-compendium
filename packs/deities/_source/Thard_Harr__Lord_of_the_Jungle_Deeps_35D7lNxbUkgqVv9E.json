Though distanced from his kin emotionally and geographically, Thard Harr nonetheless shares the blood of Moradin. Patron of the wild dwarves who inhabit the jungles of Faerûn (notably Chult), Thard Harr protects his charges from the marauding of wild beasts, the rampages of hungry dinosaurs, and the unwanted incursions of outlanders. </p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81. </p>",
