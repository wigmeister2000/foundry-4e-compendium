Though distanced from his kin emotionally and geographically, Thard Harr nonetheless shares the blood of Moradin. Patron of the wild dwarves who inhabit the jungles of Faer√ªn (notably Chult), Thard Harr protects his charges from the marauding of wild beasts, the rampages of hungry dinosaurs, and the unwanted incursions of outlanders. </p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81. </p>",
