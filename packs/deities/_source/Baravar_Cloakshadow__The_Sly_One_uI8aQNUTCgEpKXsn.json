He is unforgiving of any creature who threatens his charges, and he feels no compunction against acting against those who have earned his enmity. Atlthough he shares Garl's love of a good practical joke, Baravar's jests and tricks may cause no little discomfort to the victims. He is also a thief and enjoys using illusions to confuse creatures before robbing them. </p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81. </p>",
