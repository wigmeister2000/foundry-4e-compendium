He is one of the most fun-loving deities in the multiverse, and he seems incapable of remaining still or concentrating on a single task for any extended period of time. Erevan enjoys causing trouble for its own sake, but his pranks are rarely either helpful or deadly. </p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, page(s) 81. </p>",
