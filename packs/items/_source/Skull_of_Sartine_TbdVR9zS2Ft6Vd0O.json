			"value":"<p><i>A relic left behind by Sartine when she discarded her mortal shell to enter the Shadowfell in search of the Raven Queen, the artifact is a burned, black skull that constantly emits dark smoke. It is warm to the touch.</i></p><p>The Skull of Sartine is a +4 magic orb with the following properties and powers.</p><p><b>Enhancement:</b> Attack rolls and damage rolls</p><p><b>Critical:</b> +4d6 damage</p><p><b>Properties</b></p><ul><li>You gain a +2 item bonus to History checks.</li><li>You gain darkvision.</li><li>You gain resist 10 necrotic and resist 10 fire.</li></ul><p><b>Power (Arcane, Fire, Implement) ✦ Daily (Standard Action)</b></p><p>You can use fire burst (wizard 7).</p><p><b>Power (Arcane, Conjuration, Force, Implement) ✦ Daily (Standard Action)</b></p><p>You can use Otiluke's resilient sphere (wizard 15).</p><p><b>Special:</b> Whenever one of the Skull's attack powers hits Urishtar, the dragon gains vulnerable 20 radiant (save ends).</p><h2>Goals of the Skull of Sartine</h2><ul><li>Spread the worship of the Raven Queen.</li><li>Send the living to their just reward: death.</li><li>Mercilessly stamp out those who meddle in the affairs of death and are not affiliated with the Raven Queen, especially those pledged to the demon prince Orcus.</li></ul><h2>Roleplaying the Skull of Sartine</h2><p>The Skull of Sartine speaks in harsh whispers to its possessor, using vivid metaphors to communicate its stark outlook. When first handled, the artifact asks, \"Who has the strength of will to wield the last living remnant of Sartine, Handmaiden of the Raven Queen?\"</p><h2>Concordance</h2><table><tr><th>Starting score</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>Owner gains a level</td><td>+1d10</td></tr><tr><td>Owner worships the Raven Queen</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Owner allows a wounded ally to perish naturally</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Owner kills an Orcus follower or a demon (max. 1/day)</td><td>+1</td></tr></table><br/></p><h3>Pleased (16-20)</h3><p><i>\"The Skull and I sing praises to the Raven Queen, whose realm is as pure as newly fallen snow.\"</i><bt/>The Skull clearly recognizes the wielder as a fit conduit for the glory of the Raven Queen.</p><p>The Skull's enhancement bonus increases to +5.</p><p><b>Critical:</b> +5d6 damage</p><p><b>Property</b></p><p>This weapon deals an extra 2d6 damage against demons or creatures that serve Orcus.</p><p><b>Power (Arcane, Fire, Necrotic) ✦ Daily (Minor Action)</b></p><p>You call forth an aura of blackfire (aura 5) that lasts until the end of the encounter. Any enemy that enters or starts its turn within the aura take 5 necrotic damage and 5 fire damage.</p><h3>Satisfied (12–15)</h3><p><i>\"The Skull shows me the true nature of life and death, and it constantly tests my resolve and commitment to the ideals of the Raven Queen.\"</i><bt/>The Skull believes it may have found the perfect conduit, but it isn't completely sure. While it continues to teach and test, it grants its wielder additional power against the enemies of the Raven Queen.</p><p><b>Power (Arcane, Fire, Implement, Necrotic) ✦ Daily (Standard Action)</b></p><p>You can hurl a ball of blackfire from the Skull (area burst 1 within 10 squares); Wisdom vs. Reflex; 3d10 + Wisdom modifier necrotic and fire damage.</p><p><b>Power ✦ Encounter (Minor Action)</b></p><p>You can recognize an agent of Orcus; close burst 3; Wisdom vs. Will; with a success, you know if a character has knowingly allied with Orcus or aided a known agent of Orcus within the past year.</p><h3>Normal (5–11)</h3><p><i>\"This Skull whispers to me, demanding that I walk in the shadow of the Raven Queen and spread her immortal words.\"</i><bt/>The Skull cautiously explores the nature of the new wielder, determining his or her devotion to the Raven Queen, attitude about death and dying, and outlook concerning Orcus and his agents.</p><h3>Unsatisfied (1–4)</h3><p><i>\"The Skull whispers terrible things to me, explaining to me over and over again that only the Raven Queen can send my soul to its ultimate destiny. And reminding me that neither the Skull nor the Raven Queen is particularly happy with my performance.\"</i><bt/>The Skull is not pleased with the wielder, and will soon depart in search of a more appropriate host.</p><p><b>Special:</b> You take a -2 penalty to attack rolls and damage rolls against creatures other than demons or those that serve Orcus. This applies whether or not you are using or even holding the Skull.</p><h3>Angered (0 or lower)</h3><p><i>\"I have failed the Raven Queen, and even the Skull rejects me!\"</i><bt/>The Skull will not remain in the wielder's possession for much longer.</p><p>The Skull's enhancement bonus drops to +3.</p><p><b>Critical:</b> +3d6 damage</p><p><b>Special:</b> You take a -5 penalty to attack rolls and damage rolls against creatures other than demons or those that serve Orcus. This applies whether or not you are using or even holding the Skull.</p><h2>Moving On</h2><p><i>\"The Skull must rest for a time, regaining its strength and power until the Raven Queen again has need of its services.\"</i><bt/>The Skull knows the time has come to leave its current wielder. When the character next drops to 0 hit points, the skull explodes in a burst of black fire (burst 3; automatic hit against all enemies in burst (if satisfied or better) or against all creatures in burst (if unsatisfied or angered); 15 necrotic and 15 fire damage). The Skull reconstitutes again in the Tomb of Sartine, seeking a new champion of the Raven Queen. If the Skull is at least satisfied when it moves on, it leaves behind a magic orb +5 for the wielder to use in its place.</p>",
