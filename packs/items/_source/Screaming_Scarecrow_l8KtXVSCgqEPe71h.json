When a creature within 4 squares of a screaming scarecrow triggers a condition that was set when the scarecrow is placed (such as \"a creature passes through the area without saying a password,\" or \"a human enters the area\"), the scarecrow begins to scream. When this happens, any other screaming scarecrow within 50 feet of it also begins to scream.\\nIf a creature attempts to use Stealth to bypass a screaming scarecrow, the scarecrow uses the passive Perception of the creature that placed it, with a +10 bonus.
