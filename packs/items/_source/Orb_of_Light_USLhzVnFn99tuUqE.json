			"value":"<p class=\"flavour\"><i>The Orb of Light appears to be a large and faintly glowing white pearl. When worn or wielded by a character capable of using a holy symbol as an implement, its surface shows the image of that character's deity.</i></p><p>The Orb of Light is a +2 holy symbol with the following properties and powers.</p><p class=\"basics\"><b>Enhancement:</b> Attack rolls and damage rolls</p><p class=\"basics\"><b>Critical:</b> +2d6 radiant damage, or +2d10 radiant damage against undead creatures</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Property</b></p><p>You can speak and understand Supernal and read the Supernal script.</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Power ✦ Encounter (Standard Action)</b></p><p>You can use turn undead (cleric class feature).</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Power ✦ Encounter (Standard Action)</b></p><p>You can use radiant smite (paladin 1).</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Power (Implement) ✦ Daily (Standard Action)</b></p><p>You can make an attack against each undead creature within 10 squares, using Wisdom vs. Will. On a hit, pull the target 8 squares.</p><h2>Goals of the Orb of Light</h2><ul><li>Destroy the undead, which are abominations on the earth.</li><li>Protect the living from the depredations of the undead.</li><li>Defeat the plans of Orcus and his allies and servants.</li></ul><h2>Roleplaying the Orb of Light</h2><p>The Orb of Light rarely speaks to its owner. Instead, it sends the possessor emotions and, on occasion, inspirational images. Before a particularly dangerous and difficult battle against the undead, it might help its wielder feel less afraid by revealing a brief vision of all the people whose lives will be saved if the monsters are vanquished.</p><h2>Concordance</h2><table><tr><th>Starting score</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>Owner gains a level</td><td>+1d10</td></tr><tr><td>Owner successfully protects someone from undead</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Owner destroys an undead creature 1 or more levels higher than he is (maximum 1/day)</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Owner fails to destroy an undead creature (maximum 1/encounter)</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>Owner flees from an undead creature (maximum 1/day)</td><td>-1</td></tr></table><br/></p><h3>Transcendent (21 or higher)</h3><p>\"I am a just and good servant of life.\"</i><bt/>The Orb grants its possessor great power against the undead, engendering a mighty champion of good.</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Power ✦ Daily (Free Action)</b></p><p>When you hit an undead creature and deal radiant damage, that target is stunned until the end of its next turn.</p><h3>Pleased (16-20)</h3><p><i>\"I am the scourge of the unliving, a protector of life and a champion of the divine and radiant forces of good.\"</i><bt/>The Orb of Light knows it has found a worthy owner who is dedicated to purifying the world of foul undead horrors.</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Property</b></p><p>You gain a +1 bonus to all defenses against undead creatures.</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Power ✦ Encounter (Immediate Interrupt)</b></p><p>When an ally within 5 squares of you is hit by an attack. You can use shielding word (cleric 10), but only against attacks made by undead creatures.</p><h3>Satisfied (12–15)</h3><p><i>\"I am a righteous protector of the living against the horrors of the walking dead.\"</i><bt/>The owner has proved to be a heroic champion of the living, but the Orb of Light knows more is possible, and it urges the possessor onward to greatness.</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Power ✦ Daily (Standard Action)</b></p><p>You can use searing light (cleric 7).</p><h3>Normal (5–11)</h3><p><i>\"I must smite the undead horrors that walk the earth.\"</i><bt/>The Orb is quietly watchful, providing its new owner with a comforting sense that protecting the living from the dead is a righteous and holy calling.</p><h3>Unsatisfied (1–4)</h3><p><i>\"The Orb is disappointed in me.\"</i><bt/>The Orb thinks its owner might be unsatisfactory, but is willing to yet abide a while. It communicates less readily with its possessor, but expresses great satisfaction when pleased.</p><p class=\"basics\"><b>Special:</b> If an encounter includes undead enemies, you gain a -2 penalty to attacks that do not include an undead creature. This penalty applies whether you are using or even holding the Orb of Light.</p><h3>Angered (0 or lower)</h3><p><i>\"The Orb considers me unworthy to bear it.\"</i><bt/>The Orb urges its owner to find someone else worthy to carry it, even as it throws the possessor into confrontation with the undead. Eventually, the artifact vanishes.</p><p class=\"basics\"><b>Special:</b> Once per day, at the start of an encounter including undead enemies, the Orb teleports you to a space within 10 squares that is adjacent to the greatest number of undead. This penalty applies whether you are using or even holding the Orb.</p><h2>Moving On</h2><p><i>\"We have made the world a better place.\"</i><bt/>One morning, the Orb is gone, replaced by a luminescent (but mundane) pearl worth 5,000 gp. The former owner gains a permanent +1 bonus to AC against attacks by undead creatures.<bt/>If the owner failed the Orb, the next time the character lifts it, the artifact crumbles into coal, leaving permanent marks on the character's hand. The former owner takes a permanent -1 penalty to AC against attacks by undead creatures. The Orb reappears elsewhere in the world, ready to be claimed by another aspirant.</p>",
