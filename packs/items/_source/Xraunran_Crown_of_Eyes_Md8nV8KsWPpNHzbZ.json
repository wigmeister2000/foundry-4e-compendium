			"value":"<p><i>Once you are linked to this cabochon-adorned metal circlet, your mind can access the eyes and ears of any wearer and attempt to influence the wearer's mind.</i></p><p><b>Artifact:</b> Head slot item</p><p><b>Property</b></p><p>You can see and hear what the crown's wearer sees and hears. This does not allow you to control the wearer's head, the direction it faces, or its movements; the wearer's field of view and range of hearing limit yours. When the crown is not being worn, you can see and hear out of it as if you were gazing at any angle from any of its gems.</p><p><b> Attack Power (Charm) ✦ Daily (Standard Action)</b></p><p><i>Attack:</i> Ranged unlimited on the same plane (the crown's wearer); your level + 3 vs. Will</p><p><i>Hit:</i> You impart an emotion or an idea to the wearer. The emotion can have an image attached (such as of a particular person, a type of creature, an item, or a place), and the idea (whether true or false) must be expressed as a single sentence in a language understood by the wearer.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This power is most effective when the wearer is praying or asleep and dreaming. The wearer typically believes that the idea or statement was imparted by a deity, an ancestor, a haunting, or its own subconscious. Regardless, the crown of eyes does not control the decisions or actions of the wearer, who is free to respond as desired.</p>",
