Wolfsbane is dangerous to handle, because it is poisonous to humanoids in sufficient quantities. A bundle of wolfsbane is usually enough to keep at bay a lycanthrope that lacks serious resolve; lycanthropes find its smell sickening, and though it cannot truly harm them, most go out of their way to avoid it.\\nAs a poison, wolfsbane has the same effect as ground thassil root (Dungeon Master's Guide, page 51). Lycanthropes experience a feeling of discomfort when within 30 feet of a bundle of wolfsbane, and any lycanthrope with a Fortitude of 17 or lower cannot willingly enter a square adjacent to a bundle of wolfsbane.\\nPublished in Heroes of the Feywild, page(s) 135.</i></p><p>A flowering plant found both in the natural world and the Feywild, wolfsbane is a key ingredient in a number of potions and alchemical formulas associated with warding off or harming lycanthropes.
