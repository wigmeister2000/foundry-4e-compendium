			"value":"<p><i>A shard of the Heart of the Abyss is concentrated corruption.</i></p><p><b>Wondrous Item</b><b>:</b> Rare</p>\n<p><b>Property:</b> <p>Every round a creature other than a demon touches or holds the naked crystal, it must make a saving throw. On an unsuccessful saving throw it loses 1d4 healing surges and is dominated (save ends, -2 penalty to saving throws). While dominated, the creature takes on demonic features such as wings, horns, scales, burning eyes, claws, mandibles, or similar features. On its turn, it attacks its closest former ally. It continues to do so each turn until it saves against the domination. If the creature fails three saving throws, it is permanently corrupted, and becomes a demonic version of its former self.</p></p>\n<p><b>Power - Daily (Standard Action)</b></p><p>In conjunction with the proper ritual, the shard has the ability to kill a god and transfer some amount of that god's power and influence into another creature. The time required and the amount of power transferred is highly variable. When the process is complete, the god dies, and the shard makes a saving throw; on a failed saving throw, the shard disintegrates.</p>",
