You purchase as many gold pieces worth of components as you need or can afford. You can use the components associated with a key skill for any ritual that uses that skill. Ritual components are not interchangeable; you can't use alchemical reagents to perform a ritual requiring sanctified incense, for example. But you can use residuum for any ritual.\\nYou can buy ritual components at some shops, your allies can provide them (sharing the cost of a ritual with you), or you might find them as treasure.
