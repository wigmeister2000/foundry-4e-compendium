It is particularly keen to attack aquatic and elemental creatures that are not worshipers of Melora or Sekolah. If the bearer fails to act quickly and decisively, Wave becomes angry, insulting and cursing him or her before subsiding into sullen silence.</p><h2>Wave Lore</h2><p><b>Arcana DC 18:</b> This trident was crafted by giants who were imprisoned by aquatic enemies and turned away from their primordial masters, becoming devout followers of Sekolah, exarch of Melora.</p><h2>Concordance</h2><table><tr><th>Starting score</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>Owner gains a level</td><td>+1d10</td></tr><tr><td>Owner worships Melora or one of her exarchs</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Owner kills an aquatic or elemental creature that does not worship Melora or one of her exarchs (maximum 1/day)</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Owner refuses to attack an aquatic or elemental creature that does not worship Melora or her exarchs when the opportunity arises (maximum 1/day)</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>Owner attacks a creature that worships Melora or her exarchs (maximum 1/encounter)</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>Owner is an aquatic or elemental creature that does not worship Melora or her exarchs</td><td>-4</td></tr></table><br/></p><h3>Pleased (16-20)</h3><p><i>\"The unyielding power of the tides flows through me, and I guide that power in Melora's name.\"</i><bt/>Wave and its bearer are fully aligned, working together to spread the word of Melora.</p><p>The artifact's enhancement bonus becomes +4.</p><p><b>Critical:</b> +4d6 damage, or +4d10 damage against an aquatic or elemental creature that does not worship Melora or one of her exarchs.</p><p><b>Properties</b></p><ul><li>When using this weapon, you deal 1d10 extra damage against aquatic or elemental creatures that do not worship Melora or one of her exarchs.</li><li>When aquatic or elemental creatures that do not worship Melora or one of her exarchs flank you, you do not grant combat advantage to them.</li></ul><p><b>Power ✦ Daily (Standard Action)</b></p><p>Until you take an extended rest, each ally within 20 squares of you can breathe water as if under the effect of the Water Breathing ritual.</p><h3>Satisfied (12–15)</h3><p><i>\"Though I am born of dry land, my soul is of the sea.\"</i><bt/>Wave is content with its wielder but believes that he or she could make greater efforts toward its goals.</p><p><b>Property</b></p><p>While wielding Wave, you gain the aquatic keyword (MM 280).</p><p><b>Power ✦ Daily (Standard Action)</b></p><p>Until the end of the encounter, each ally within 10 squares of you can breathe water as if under the effect of the Water Breathing ritual.</p><h3>Normal (5–11)</h3><p><i>\"Wave demands that I worship Melora and spread the glory of the waves.\"</i><bt/>Wave awaits the wielder to prove amenable to aiding its goals.</p><h3>Unsatisfied (1–4)</h3><p><i>\"The trident is displeased with me, and its anger grows.\"</i><bt/>The wielder is making no effort to spread the word of Melora.

Now it seeks to move on.\"</i><bt/>Wave wants to go where it can pursue its goals. When the wielder next gains a level, the artifact disappears, its sentience and other abilities traveling to another land in search of help in spreading Melora's word. If Wave is at least satisfied when it departs, its former wielder gains a swim speed equal to his or her land speed.</p>",
