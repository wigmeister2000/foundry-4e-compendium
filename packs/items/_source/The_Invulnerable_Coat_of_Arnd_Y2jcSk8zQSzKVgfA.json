			"value":"<p><i>This gleaming chain mail belonged to a poor cleric of Kord who fought to free his village from its tyrannical baron. Imbued with the cleric's fighting spirit and holy strength, the Invulnerable Coat of Arnd seeks to reclaim its ancient glory.</i></p><p>The Invulnerable Coat of Arnd is a suit of +2 chainmail.</p><p><b>Enhancement:</b> AC</p><p><b>Properties</b></p><ul><li>You gain resist 5 acid, resist 5 fire, and resist 5 lightning.</li><li>You gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws.</li></ul><p><b>Power (Divine, Weapon) ✦ At-Will (Standard Action)</b></p><p>You can use valiant strike (paladin 1).</p><p><b>Power ✦ At-Will (Minor Action)</b></p><p>Change one of the resistances granted by the armor to any of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, psychic, or radiant. That resistance remains changed until you use the power to change it again.</p><p><b>Power ✦ At-Will (Minor Action)</b></p><p>Change the Invulnerable Coat into plate armor, scale armor, or chainmail.</p><p><b>Power (Healing) ✦ Encounter (Minor Action)</b></p><p>You can spend a healing surge.</p><h2>Goals of the Invulnerable Coat of Arnd</h2><ul><li>Attach itself to a hero who will be remembered in legend.</li><li>Prove itself against ever greater threats and challenges.</li><li>Overthrow tyrants.</li></ul><h2>Roleplaying the Invulnerable Coat of Arnd</h2><p>The Invulnerable Coat thrives on danger, so it urges its wearer to take on increasingly difficult risks. The Invulnerable Coat's not happy unless the wearer is throwing himself into battle. Planning and strategy aren't high on the artifact's list of priorities. The Invulnerable Coat doesn't communicate with its wearer, but its emotional state does rub off, so the owner feels elated in battle and despairs at defeat.</p><h2>Concordance</h2><table><tr><th>Starting score</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>Owner gains a level</td><td>+1d10</td></tr><tr><td>Owner receives public acclaim for completing a major quest</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Owner defeats an enemy three or more levels higher than he is (maximum 1/day)</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Owner falls to 0 hit points in battle</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>Owner flees from combat</td><td>-1</td></tr></table><br/></p><h3>Pleased (16-20)</h3><p><i>\"There is no limit to the brave deeds we can accomplish.\"</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Invulnerable Coat of Arnd is excited to have such a hero to protect. It starts to literally glow with pride, constantly shedding dim light in a 2-square radius.</p><p><b>Properties</b></p><ul><li>You gain resist 10 acid, resist 10 fire, and resist 10 lightning. This supersedes the normal resistances granted by the artifact.</li><li>You gain a +5 bonus to Will defense against fear effects.</li></ul><p><b>Power ✦ Daily (Minor Action)</b></p><p>You call forth an aura of courage (aura 2) that lasts until the end of your next turn. You and any ally within the aura gain a +5 bonus to attack rolls.</p><h3>Satisfied (12–15)</h3><p><i>\"We are destined for greatness.\"</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Invulnerable Coat of Arnd is pleased with the wielder's bravery and drive, so it devotes more of its power to urging him on to greater glory.</p><p><b>Property</b></p><p>You gain a +2 bonus to Will defense against fear effects.</p><p><b>Power ✦ Daily (Free Action)</b></p><p>Gain 1 action point.</p><h3>Normal (5–11)</h3><p><i>\"Glory waits for no one—we must seize it by the throat!\"</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Coat wants its wielder to put himself in harm's way, and it urges him toward acts of daring.</p><h3>Unsatisfied (1–4)</h3><p><i>\"All is not lost—I can still redeem myself!\"</i></p><p><b>Special:</b> You take a -2 penalty to all defenses against creatures whose level is equal to or lower than yours.</p><h3>Angered (0 or lower)</h3><p><i>\"I'm not worthy of armor this fine.\"</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Coat regards its wielder as a coward and urges him to find someone more worthy to wear it.</p><p>The artifact's enhancement bonus to AC drops to +1.</p><p><b>Special:</b> You take a -5 penalty to all defenses against creatures whose level is equal to or lower than yours.</p><h2>Moving On</h2><p><i>\"Our names shall live on in legend.\"</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Invulnerable Coat recognizes that its wielder's bravery needs no further assistance.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wielder next gains a level, the Invulnerable Coat crumbles into residuum worth 5,000 gp. Its magic and sentience appear elsewhere in the world, encased in a new suit of armor.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the wielder gains a permanent +1 bonus to Diplomacy checks and Intimidate checks. Even those who do not know of his bravery recognize an aura of greatness around him—a remnant of the Coat.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Invulnerable Coat moves on because it is unsatisfied with the wielder, then the wielder receives a permanent -1 penalty to Diplomacy and Intimidate checks, and the armor crumbles into worthless dust.</p>",
