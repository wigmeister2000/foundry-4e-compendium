They animate only enough to speak, and they display moderate intelligence. You can question them and learn what has transpired within the last 24 hours in their immediate surroundings. Their knowledge includes only things that would be obvious to normal senses. For instance, they would know that a horseman passed by an hour ago, but they would not know that an invisible creature sneaked past.</p>",
