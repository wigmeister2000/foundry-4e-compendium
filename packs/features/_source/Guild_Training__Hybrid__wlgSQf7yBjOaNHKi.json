			"value":"<p>Assassins gain their abilities by following a training regimen developed by a particular guild. Even an assassin taught by an individual master studies a set of teachings that were once developed by a guild. </p><p>Assassins' guilds claim towns and other territories as their hunting grounds. Nonguild assassins who seek to practice their art must first gain the permission of the local grandmaster of assassins. In some areas, particularly large cities that have many potential contracts, two guilds go to war for control of the slayers' trade. In that situation, you must choose a side or face the wrath of both factions. </p><p>Choose a method of training. The choice you make gives you the benefit described below and also provides bonuses to certain assassin powers, as detailed in those powers. </p>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-4e-compendium.module-features.J2I7pDZhPnKCHiaN]{Bleak Disciple (Hybrid)}@UUID[Compendium.dnd-4e-compendium.module-features.tOqiF2SKRYwz8eI5]{Night Stalker (Hybrid)}",
