Twelve hours after that-24 hours after your death-you arrive, equipped as you were when you died, having just walked back from wherever it is you and your DM decided you awoke after you were slain. Your condition is the same as if you had been subject to a Raise Dead ritual, but without any death penalty. </p><p>You can choose to arrive at the place of your death, at the location of any of your allies, or at any location you consider home. There's a final purpose in your existence, and it's not random death. </p><p>Published in Martial Power, page(s) 152. </p>",
