			"value":"<p>Work with your DM to build a small network of contacts&mdash;three to five individuals. It takes 2d6 hours for your contacts to respond to your requests, so you can turn to your network for help only once per day. Your contacts aid you as long as doing so does not pose a significant risk to them. Your DM decides whether your contacts can and<br>will help you, and if their help is valuable. If your DM determines that your contacts cannot help you, you learn that fact within 1d4 hours, and you don't expend the use of this feature. When your contacts aid you, choose one of following benefits:<br><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhCwALAMQSAEVCVlsyRmEyRWAyRWYyRURCVlcyRmQyRVI7T09FWGIyRVUyRlUyR1EzSHQyQ05EV0RCVyIyTH8yQgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAABIALAAAAAALAAsAAAUsoCSKwWiKCnSaUbSsUtFG5ShAc4s4UpL/DAkBl2ucHrMBDBAxwESAp+hwCgEAOw==\" alt=\"\"> A +4 power bonus to one knowledge check, Streetwise check, or any other check the DM decides the contact can aid you with.
