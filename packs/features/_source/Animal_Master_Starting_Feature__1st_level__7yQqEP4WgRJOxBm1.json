			"value":"Choose one of the five animals described below&mdash;cat, dog, hawk, monkey, or raven&mdash;to be your animal minion. This creature accompanies you for as long as it lives. The animal doesn't have a normal complement of actions, but it can take a move action when you take one. If it has a power, it can use it only on your turn. (With your DM's consent, you can substitute any similar creature for these choices; for example, an otter would be much like a cat with a skill bonus for swimming instead of climbing and jumping, and a badger is pretty close to a small dog in size and abilities.)<br>In addition, you gain the distracting attack power.<br>",
