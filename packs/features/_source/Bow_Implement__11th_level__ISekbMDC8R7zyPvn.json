Add the bow's enhancement bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls, as well as to any extra damage granted by a property (if applicable) when using the bow as an implement. You do not add your weapon proficiency bonus to the attack roll when you use your bow as an implement. </p><p>When you use a bow as an implement for a ranged bard attack power, the power's range is increased to the bow's normal range (if the power's range is shorter). You can also use the power at the bow's long range, with the normal -2 penalty to the attack roll. </p>",
