			"value":"<p>As you attain certain levels, you learn two new wizard powers and add them to your spellbook (two wizard utility powers at 2nd level, for instance). At the end of each of your extended rests, you choose a number of wizard powers from your spellbook and prepare them. The number you can prepare is determined by your level.</p>\n<p>The powers that you prepare are the wizard powers that you can use during the coming day, in addition to your at-will attack powers and powers from another source, such as racial powers. If you do not prepare powers from your spellbook after an extended rest (for example, if you do not have access to your spellbook), you can use the same powers you had prepared on the previous day. See the Wizard Powers Learned table for the levels at which you add wizard powers to your spellbook.</p>\n<p>Any wizard encounter attack power that you add to your spellbook through this class feature functions as a daily attack power for you. In other words, you can use it once per day, rather than once per encounter, and you can use the power again only after an extended rest. Because the power functions as a daily attack power, you cannot regain its use from any effect that recharges encounter attack powers.</p>\n<p>Find your level on the Wizard Powers Prepared per Day table. The row corresponding to your level indicates how many wizard encounter attack powers and wizard utility powers you can prepare each day. (The table does not account for powers that you might have from another source, such as a paragon path.) You cannot prepare more than one attack power and one utility power of any given level on the same day.</p>\n<p>WIZARD POWERS LEARNED</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Level </strong></td>\n<td><strong>Encounter as Daily </strong></td>\n<td><strong>Utility </strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3-4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7-8</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11-14</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17-18</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20-21</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>22</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>23-24</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>25</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>26-28</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>29</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>30</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>WIZARD POWERS PREPARED PER DAY</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Level </strong></td>\n<td><strong>Encounter as Daily </strong></td>\n<td><strong>Utility </strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2-4</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6-8</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10-15</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16-21</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>22-30</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",
