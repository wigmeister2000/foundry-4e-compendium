			"value":"<p>You add two new wizard encounter attack powers to your spellbook. The powers must be of 27th level or lower, and the two function as daily attack powers for you.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.9A1LUy745QhwxMGP]{Black Fire}@UUID[Compendium.dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.fwZk658pceGVMQ3x]{Confusion}@UUID[Compendium.dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.ndCO2MRKp0lYbk4q]{Forcecage}</p>\n<p>Using a Weapon as an Implement</p>\n<p>Like all bladesingers, you can channel magic through your chosen blade, treating it as an implement. When you use the weapon as an implement, it works like a normal implement, but you gain neither the weapon's proficiency bonus nor its nonmagical properties, such as high crit or versatile. A weapon's range and damage dice are usually irrelevant to implement powers, since such powers tend to specify their range and damage.</p>\n<p>If your chosen blade is magical and you use it as an implement, you can also use its enhancement bonus, critical hit effect, properties, and powers. However, some magic weapons have properties and powers that function only with weapon powers.</p>\n<p>Published in Neverwinter Campaign Setting, page(s) 66.</p>",
