However, just as druids seek balance in the world between divine and primordial forces, druids pursue balance within their own minds and bodies. </p><p>You begin with three at-will attack powers. Throughout your career, at least one of those powers, and no more than two, must have the beast form keyword. By this means, you have access to useful attacks in either beast form or humanoid form. </p>",
