			"value":"<p>Your origin changes to immortal, and you cease to age. You gain the ability to speak Supernal, resist 15 fire, and resist 15 radiant. You are immune to fear. </p><p>You gain a pair of angelic wings, which you can manifest or conceal as a minor action. While your wings are manifested, you can fly at a speed equal to your speed + 2, but you land at the end of your turn. If your turn ends while you are still flying, you swiftly descend and land without taking falling damage. While your wings are concealed, your angelic nature is hidden, and you resemble the mortal you once were. </p><p>If you already have wings from some other source (such as the favored soul paragon path; see page 23), these angelic wings take the place of the wings you previously gained. </p>",
