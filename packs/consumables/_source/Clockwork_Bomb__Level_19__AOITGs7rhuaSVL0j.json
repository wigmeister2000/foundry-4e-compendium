			"value":"<p><i>You set the device on the ground and hope that it detonates when you want it to.</i></p><p><p>Place the clockwork bomb in your space or in a square adjacent to you, and decide how many rounds pass before the bomb goes off (6 rounds maximum). Each round, at the start of your turn, move the clockwork bomb one square in a direction of your choosing and roll a d6. On a roll of 6, the bomb detonates prematurely. If the clockwork bomb is hit by an attack (the bomb has the same defenses as its user), it also explodes. When the bomb detonates, make an attack: Area burst 1 centered on the bomb's space; targets each creature in burst; +22 vs. Reflex; 4d12 fire damage. </p><p><b>Special: </b>Once the bomb is set, it can be disabled with a DC 27 Thievery check. </p> </p>\n<p><b>Alchemical Item</b></p>\n<p><b>Power - Consumable (Minor Action)</b></p><p>Place the clockwork bomb in your space or in a square adjacent to you, and decide how many rounds pass before the bomb goes off (6 rounds maximum).
