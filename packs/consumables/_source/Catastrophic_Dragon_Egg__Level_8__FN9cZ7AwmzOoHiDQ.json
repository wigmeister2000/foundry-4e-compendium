			"value":"<p><i>With a cataclysmic roar, the egg fractures under the pressure of the elemental power within it.</i></p><p><b>Consumable</b><b>:</b> Uncommon</p>\n<p><b>Power - Consumable (Standard Action)</b></p><p>Effect: You hurl the egg up to 10 squares, where it creates a zone in a close burst 5 that lasts until the end of the encounter. The zone is difficult terrain, and the one's damage starts at 5, increasing to 10 at level 18 and 15 at level 28. The type of egg, as follows, determines the zone's damage type and other effects.</p><p>Avalanche: Creatures that have earth walk ignore the zone's difficult terrain. Any creature that starts its turn in the zone takes damage and must succeed on a saving throw or fall prone. As an opportunity action, you slide a creature that falls prone in the zone up to 2 squares.</p><p>Blizzard (cold): Creatures that have ice walk ignore the zone's difficult terrain. The zone is heavily obscured. Any creature that starts its turn in the zone takes cold damage and is slowed until the start of its next turn.</p><p>Earthquake: Creatures that have earth walk ignore the zone's difficult terrain. Any creature that starts its turn in the zone takes damage and must succeed on a saving throw or fall prone. A creature in the zone cannot stand up during the turn in which it falls prone.</p><p>Tornado (cold, lightning): The zone is lightly obscured. Any creature that starts its turn in the zone takes cold and lightning damage, and the creature is slowed until the start of its next turn. As a minor action, you slide each slowed creature in the zone up to 3 squares.</p><p>Typhoon (lightning, thunder): Any creature that starts its turn in the zone takes lightning and thunder damage. As a minor action, you pull each creature in the zone up to 2 squares toward the zone's central square. A creature that would be pulled into the zone's central square falls prone instead.</p><p>Volcanic (fire, poison): The zone is lightly obscured. Any creature that starts its turn in the zone takes ongoing fire and poison damage, and it loses any fire resistance it has (save ends both).</p><p>Wildfire (fire): Creatures with fire resistance ignore the zone's difficult terrain.
