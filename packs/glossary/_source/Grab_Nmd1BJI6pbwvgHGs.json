				"content":"<h1>Grab</h1><p>By using the grab power, any creature can try to seize a target bodily and keep it from moving. Although class powers and monster powers are usually more effective than grab at locking a target down, the advantage of grab is that anyone can use it, regardless of class.<br/><br/>GRAB: STANDARD ACTION<br/><br/>Target: You can attempt to grab a creature that is smaller than you, the same size category as you, or<br/>one category larger than you. The creature must be within your melee reach (don't count extra reach<br/>from a weapon).<br/><br/>Strength Attack: Make a Strength attack vs. Reflex. Do not add any weapon modifiers. You must have at least one hand free to make a grab attempt. <br/>Hit: The enemy is immobilized until it escapes or you end the grab. Your enemy can attempt to escape on its turn.<br/><br/>Sustaining a Grab: You sustain a grab as a minor action. You can end a grab as a free action.<br/><br/>Effects that End a Grab: If you are affected by a condition that prevents you from taking opportunity actions (such as dazed, stunned, surprised, or unconscious), you immediately let go of a grabbed enemy. If you move away from the creature you're grabbing, you let go and the grab ends. If a pull, a push, or a slide moves you or the creature you're grabbing out of your reach, the grab ends.</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 290, Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 220, Rules Compendium, page(s) 243.</p>"
