			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Geography </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Eberron </p><p>The center of the remaining Five Nations and the heart of the Silver Flame, Thrane has a heightened sense of its own importance. A major military and economic power in the region, Thrane's theocratic government is ostensibly devoted to stamping out evil and making life better for all. However, privileges of power can sometimes lead to arrogance and corruption. Still, Thrane's people aspire to lead virtuous lives, and Thrane could potentially become the brightest light in a darkened world. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Intimidate,Religion </p><p>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 131. </p>",
