			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Society </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p>You grew up in the wake of an army on the march, surviving on its scraps. Perhaps your parents were members of the army who later died, or maybe you were in a settlement destroyed by the force. Regardless, you decided the only way to survive and learn to defend yourself was to follow the army. You slept when possible, and when you found yourself in inhospitable conditions, you made do with what you could steal. Your existence sometimes depended on keeping out of sight. You probably jumped from army to army-when one force crushed another, you would ride on the heels of the victors. Did you grow up and eventually join the ranks, or did this formative experience leave you unwilling to be in the company of any band of warriors larger than your own adventuring party? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Endurance, Stealth </p><p>Published in Martial Power 2, page(s) 155. </p>",
