Which enclave did you guard? What unusual or famous fugitives did you meet while guarding the enclave? Did you ever break up a conflict among those who sought Ghallanda's hospitality, and does someone owe you thanks or bear a grudge as a result? Did you ever smuggle people out of your enclave-or kick them out because they were threatening others? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Perception, Insight </p><p>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 153. </p>",
