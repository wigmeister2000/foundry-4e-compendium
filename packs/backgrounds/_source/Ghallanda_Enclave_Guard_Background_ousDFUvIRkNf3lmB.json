			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>House Ghallanda </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Eberron </p><p>You were responsible for keeping everyone safe within a Ghallanda enclave, no matter what nations, Houses, or mysterious organizations wanted to violate the sanctuary of your house. Which enclave did you guard? What unusual or famous fugitives did you meet while guarding the enclave? Did you ever break up a conflict among those who sought Ghallanda's hospitality, and does someone owe you thanks or bear a grudge as a result? Did you ever smuggle people out of your enclave-or kick them out because they were threatening others? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Perception, Insight </p><p>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 153. </p>",
