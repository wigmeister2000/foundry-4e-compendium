			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Geography </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Forgotten Realms </p><p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Human, Half-Orc </p><p>In the decades since the fall of the Witch-King, hidden Zhengyian relics have been unearthed across Vaasa. For some, contact with these fell artifacts exposed the individual and their descendants with a trace of Zhengyi's dark power. Blood Mages are most prevalent among the half-orcs of Palischuk; among them, Knight-Vindicator Mansard Kanaoth-the only half-orc on the Ironfell Council. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, Bluff </p><p>Published in Dungeon Magazine 177, page(s) 80. </p>",
