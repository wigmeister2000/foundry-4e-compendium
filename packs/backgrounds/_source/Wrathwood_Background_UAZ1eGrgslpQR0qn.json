			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Geography </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p>Blanketing a secluded valley, steeped in ancient magic, is the Wrathwood. This brooding forest has never felt the bite of an axe or the flame's hungry touch, for the woodland defends itself. One does not live in the Wrathwood without the permission of the trees; even the animals and insects sheltering beneath the boughs show deep reverence for their homeland. The Wrathwood does not welcome sentient beings, but those who show deference to and respect for the trees are tolerated and might even be allowed to make their homes in the cool shadows cast by towering redwoods. </p><p>You have a special connection to the Wrathwood and carry the lessons of your homeland with you as you venture into the world. Elves, eladrin, gnomes, and other races with strong connections to nature hail from this homeland. Any primal class can originate in the Wrathwood, though druids are the most common. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Perception, Stealth </p><p>Associated Languages: Elven </p><p>Published in Primal Power, page(s) 132. </p>",
