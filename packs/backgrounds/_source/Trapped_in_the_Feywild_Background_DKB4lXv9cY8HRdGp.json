While there, you had your first brush with arcane magic and the odd fey creatures that inhabit the realm. Did you wander into the Feywild by mistake and lose your way home? Were you captured and placed in bondage by fomorians or other cruel fey? How did you escape from the Feywild? Do you want to go back and clean up some loose ends, or do you want to avoid the plane for good? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, Endurance </p><p>Associated Languages: Elven </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 387, page(s) 81. </p>",
