(Bralani of autumn winds, ghaele of winter, and coure of mischief and strife are examples of the many possible titles.) Do you feel a special affinity for a season, passion, or other natural or emotional phenomenon associated with your parent's title? You probably have much stronger ties to the Feywild than to the world. Why are you now adventuring in the world? When was the first time you visited the world, and what was your reaction to it? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Intimidate, Nature </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 181. </p>",
