			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Campaign </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Scales of War Adventure Path </p><p>You make powerful weapons and armor, instruments of warfare both elegant and deadly. Who taught you your craft, and what is your relationship like with your mentor? Is there something you've always wanted to make, but you've lacked the proper materials for it? To what degree do you insist on wielding weapons you make yourself, and how do you react when you examine someone else's work? </p><p>Good Background: Dwarf. </p><p><i>Benefit: </i>You can construct your own weapons and armor, given proper tools and raw materials. Making a weapon takes two days, and making armor takes four days. Doing so confers no economic advantage, however. The item ultimately costs the same as it would if you'd purchased it directly. And you can cast Creation rituals as if you had the Ritual Caster feat. </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 366, page(s) 54. </p>",
