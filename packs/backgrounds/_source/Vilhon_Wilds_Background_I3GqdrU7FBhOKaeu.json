Like other frontiers, the Vilhon Wilds is an ungoverned wilderness. The only vestige of civilization is the small, near-lawless city of Ormpetarr, where merchants and thieves prey on pilgrims who seek something from a visit to the Spellplague-riddled land nearby. </p><p><i>Benefit: </i>You can reroll any Dungeoneering check, but you must keep the second result, even if it is worse. </p><p>You also gain a +1 bonus to initiative checks. </p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Player's Guide, page(s) 126. </p>",
