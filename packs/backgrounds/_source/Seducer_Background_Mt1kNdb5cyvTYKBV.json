			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Campaign </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Scales of War Adventure Path </p><p>You can't keep away from romantic liaisons with the attractive and the alluring. And after practice, you're good at it, having slept your way through a dozen manor-houses and noble villas. How mercenary are your seductions-do you genuinely fall in love easily, or is there always an ulterior motive? Are you motivated by the sheer beauty of your paramours, the chase and conquest, or the fringe benefits of bedding the wealthy and influential? Is there someone who got away, or someone unusually resistant to your charms? </p><p>Good Background: Eladrin. </p><p><i>Benefit: </i>You add Bluff and Insight to your class skill list, and you gain a +1 bonus to Bluff and Insight checks. </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 366, page(s) 55. </p>",
