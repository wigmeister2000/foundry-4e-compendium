You left your training before attaining full membership in this shadowy group: Why did you leave? What drew you to the Ghorad'din in the first place-or did they seek you out? Can you still count on the aid of the Ghorad'din? Or do you fear they'll try to knife you in the shadows someday? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Bluff, Stealth </p><p>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 154. </p>",
