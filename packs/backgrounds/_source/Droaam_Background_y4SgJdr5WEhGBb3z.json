			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Geography </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Eberron </p><p>Droaam is a land of monsters, creatures that-to the outside eye-make even the goblin tribes of Darguun look civilized. The mountain passes of Droaam teem with giants and gargoyles, and the forests are thick with trolls and orcs more savage than the fiercest tribes of the Eldeen Reaches. Yet the region contains more than random horrors. Ruled by the mysterious Daughters of Sora Kell, Droaam grows ever more disciplined, ever more structured-and the people of Khorvaire grow ever more frightened. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Dungeoneering, Nature </p><p>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 137. </p>",
