(Cyre is one example, and plenty of others exist, from Thrane-claimed Thaliost to the hundreds of nameless hamlets devastated by the war.) You have turned to a life of wandering. But are you searching for a new home, or for a way to rebuild or reclaim your old one? Do you adventure because there's nothing else left for you? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Endurance, Streetwise </p><p>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 159. </p>",
