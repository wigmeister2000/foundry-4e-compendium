			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Racial </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Human </p><p>Many human children are born to a far-flung homestead in a wilderness claimed and somewhat tamed by their parents or extended family. As a child, you did not know the safety of walls, but only the semblance of civilization your family brought to a stretch of wilderness. Maybe that homestead still exists as a bastion of light that survives or thrives in the dark wild lands. Maybe your home was swallowed up by the savagery around it. Whatever the case, you have an understanding of the dangers of the wilderness and how to survive them that will never leave you. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Endurance, Nature </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 383, page(s) 66. </p>",
