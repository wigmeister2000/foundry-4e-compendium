Finding the threat can be a long and arduous hunt, but you enjoy the chase and savor spending long periods of time tailing your chosen prey. Though any creature can choose to give up its place within nature's hierarchy and become your quarry, aberrations are immediately and always on your list of creatures to hunt down and kill. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Dungeoneering, Stealth </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 388. </p>",
