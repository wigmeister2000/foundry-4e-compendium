			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Racial </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Elan Heritage feat </p><p>Once, you thought it possible to fight the Far Realm and its horrors. Yet for every aberrant put to the torch, for every planar breach closed, the Outside's insidious power only seems to grow. Thus it was that you made the secret petition to the Cullers and claimed your new form. Now, how will you carry out the mission that you already know will destroy you in the end? Will you take the fight directly to the aberrant menace, confident that your new strength will carry the day? Or do you abandon that cause and instead hunt down those who betray their world by seeking to control the power of the Far Realm? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Dungeoneering, Intimidate </p><p>Published in Psionic Power, page(s) 125. </p>",
