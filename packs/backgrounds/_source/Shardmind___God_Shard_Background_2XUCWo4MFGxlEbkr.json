Since you are a fragment of the Living Gate, your own power is the force that keeps the Far Realm from destroying the universe; each shardmind, in fact, is a fragment of divine power and carries a responsibility to nurture that power. Most God Shards are unaligned and revere no deity. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>History, Religion </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 13. </p>",
