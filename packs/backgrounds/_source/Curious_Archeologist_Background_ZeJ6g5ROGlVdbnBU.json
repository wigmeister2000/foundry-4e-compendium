			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Legacy of Acererak </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p>Dungeons, ruins, and old tombs house the secrets of the past, and dedicated scrutiny can reveal much of old civilizations and famous personages. So whenever an opportunity arises to examine a historical sight, you're loath to let it pass you by. While many dungeons capture your imagination, none of them has quite the same allure as does the Tomb of Horrors. </p><p>Possible Minor Quests: You might explore the corridors of Acererak's tomb, retrieve relics from the deep chambers, or seek lore about who Acererak was in life. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>History, Perception, Thievery </p><p><i>Benefit: </i>When engaging in a skill challenge to disable a trap, your first successful Thievery check grants you an extra success. </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 371, page(s) 6. </p>",
