			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Campaign </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Scales of War Adventure Path </p><p>From a young age, you were trained to track, stalk, and bring down your prey. The hunter's outlook is now pervasive in your life-your problems are merely elusive quarry that you relentlessly hunt down and ultimately claim as a trophy. Is there a particular monster you're particularly good at hunting? One that frustrates you? Or frightens you? Who taught you the art of stealth? And have you ever had the tables turned on you, when someone or something hunted you? </p><p>Good Background: Elf. </p><p><i>Benefit: </i>You add Stealth and Perception to your class skill list, and you gain a +1 bonus to Stealth and Perception checks. </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 366, page(s) 55. </p>",
