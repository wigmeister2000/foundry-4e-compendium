			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Racial </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Kalashtar </p><p>Although she does not dream, the quori nightmare can touch the dreams of others. She hears the whispers of your hopes and fears, and she can pluck terrors from your unconscious mind and turn them into deadly reality. Many quori nightmares are shamans, but you might have chosen the path of the assassin, and you combine your skills as an assassin with the power to craft nightmares. As you go about your work, you might be a grim figure even as you strike fear into the hearts of evildoers. If you chose to become a druid, you might draw your wild shape from the nightmares of others, becoming a beast never seen in reality-or even a shadow of your quori spirit. How does this make you feel, though? Do you revel in the sense of fear you instill in others, or do you see it as another tool in your arsenal of abilities? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Intimidate, Insight </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 385, page(s) 15. </p>",
