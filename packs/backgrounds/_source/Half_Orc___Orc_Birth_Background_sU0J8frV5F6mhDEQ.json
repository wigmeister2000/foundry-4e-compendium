You might have been destined for greatness, but something happened. Perhaps the tribe was slaughtered in an ill-fated raid or by a group of adventurers. Or perhaps a full-blooded orc challenged your halforc parent's leadership, and you fled to avoid certain death. How do you feel about orcs now? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Athletics </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 182. </p>",
