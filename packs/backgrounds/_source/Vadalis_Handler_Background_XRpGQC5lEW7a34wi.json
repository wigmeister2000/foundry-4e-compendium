			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>House Vadalis </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Eberron </p><p>At the house's Erlaskar Manor enclave, you saw dozens of monsters gathered from all over Khorvaire. Your job was to study them, learn how they could be put to use, train them, and eventually raise their offspring in captivity. What specific monsters did you work with? Did you feel at ease around them, or were you cautious of their inherent danger? Did the monsters ever escape or otherwise pose a danger to you and your fellow handlers? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Dungeoneering, Nature </p><p>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 158. </p>",
