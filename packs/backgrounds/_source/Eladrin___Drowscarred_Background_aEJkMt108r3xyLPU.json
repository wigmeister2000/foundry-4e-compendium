What happened? No doubt this encounter intensified your hatred of the drow. But is your hatred now mixed with fear? Or is it a burning drive to exact revenge? Perhaps something about the encounter gave you a trace of compassion for the drow. Do you hope that they might one day be redeemed and rejoin the eladrin fold? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Dungeoneering, Heal </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 181. </p>",
