You know this because one of your ancestors came to you and told you so. Of course, she was dead at the time. The vampire informed you that you would be joining the rest of the family in undeath, but that first you would be given time to produce an heir. </p><p>How was your ancestor related to you? Is your ancestor a recent conversion? Perhaps you know of vampire relatives that date back to the time of Bael Turath. How often are you in contact with your vampire </p><p>family? Do you hide from them or seek their counsel? What if you refuse to provide an heir to your bloodline? Do you have any siblings facing a similar fate? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Diplomacy, Stealth </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook Races: Tiefling, page(s) 9. </p>",
