			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Campaign </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Forgotten Realms </p><p>The Simbul, a mighty sorceress, once ruled Aglarond, serving as a bulwark against Thay's expansion. However, in the Simbul's absence, the renewed ambitions of that menacing nation constantly test Aglarond's defenses. </p><p>Elves, half-elves, and humans populate the coast and portions of the Yuirwood, earning a living from the bountiful natural resources. Some portions of the Yuirwood are shunned, for strange magic lingers in its depths. </p><p>Aglarond faces threats from beyond and within its borders. Many residents maintain hope that the Simbul will return to deliver Aglarond from its enemies, but such hopes grow increasingly dim as dangers accumulate. </p><p><i>Benefit: </i>You add Elven to your list of languages known, you add Perception to your class skill list, and you gain a +1 bonus to Perception checks. </p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Player's Guide, page(s) 76. </p>",
