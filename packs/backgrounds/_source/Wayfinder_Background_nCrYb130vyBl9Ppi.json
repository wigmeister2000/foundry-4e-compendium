Your travels revealed much about the swamp's secrets, helping you find secret paths none knew about. Why did you leave your village? Did you become lost? Was your village destroyed while you were away? Are you, perhaps, an envoy to the larger world? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Endurance, Nature </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 386, page(s) 7. </p>",
