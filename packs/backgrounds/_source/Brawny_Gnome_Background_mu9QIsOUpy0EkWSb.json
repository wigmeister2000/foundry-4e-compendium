As your friends studied the magical arts and illusions, you were more content to hunt, do physical labor, or drill with the militia. Do you prefer being straightforward and forceful over crafty and quiet? Maybe you seek to prove yourself to members of the larger races, challenging them to arm wrestling and other feats of strength or endurance. Or you might be content to let opponents underestimate you, then surprise them later with unexpected bursts of power. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Athletics, Endurance </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 384, page(s) 58. </p>",
