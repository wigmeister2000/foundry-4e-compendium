			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Legacy of Acererak </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p>The Bleak Academy keeps a stable of living slaves to murder and animate as undead when they come of age. Life in servitude to these necromancers is understandably bleak. You, though, escaped your chains and survived the long flight through the Vast Swamp to reach civilized lands. Do you want vengeance? Will you fight to liberate the others held by the necromantic cabal? </p><p>Possible Minor Quests: You might have escaped, but your former captors are not likely to let you stay free. You might have to avoid their attempts to reclaim you, so you are always moving and staying one step ahead of them. Or you might go back, intent on freeing your fellows and razing the necromancers' city. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Endurance, Religion, Stealth </p><p><i>Benefit: </i>You gain a +2 racial bonus to saving throws to end conditions and ongoing effects with the fear keyword. </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 371, page(s) 7. </p>",
