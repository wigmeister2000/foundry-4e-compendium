Maybe you became involved in a feud between rival merchant houses, or perhaps your post was plundered by raiders. Were you a clerk, a mercenary, or a laborer? Do you still have contacts with the house that employed you? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Acrobatics, Endurance </p><p>Associated Languages: Dwarven or Giant </p><p>Published in Dark Sun Campaign Setting, page(s) 152. </p>",
