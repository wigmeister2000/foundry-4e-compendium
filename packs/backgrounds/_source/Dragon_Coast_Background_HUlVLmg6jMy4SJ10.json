			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Campaign </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Forgotten Realms </p><p>Westgate is among the freest and the most disreputable locations in Faer√ªn, a place where coin can purchase anything. However, other areas have seen change in the past few decades. With the receding of the Sea of Fallen Stars, Ilipur and Pros have withered away into ghost towns. </p><p>Nathlekh, Proskur, and Teziir, meanwhile, have seen a boom in trade. These cities have undergone transformations, emerging as law-bound centers of fair trade and honest dealings. Cormyr annexed Proskur in 1405 DR and later adopted Teziir as a protectorate. On the other hand, Nathlan (and its capital, Nathlekh) has emerged as a strong, independent country-the Eastern nation of the West, as some people say. </p><p><i>Benefit: </i>You can reroll any Insight check, but you must keep the second result, even if it is worse. </p><p>You also gain one additional language of your choice. </p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Player's Guide, page(s) 92. </p>",
