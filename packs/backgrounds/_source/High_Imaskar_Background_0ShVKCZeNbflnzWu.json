			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Campaign </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Forgotten Realms </p><p>High Imaskar stands on the ruins of ancient Mulhorand, a nation shattered nearly a century ago by the Spellplague, its people destroyed, its gods vanished. In the vast emptiness came the Imaskari, appearing as if they had stepped through millennia of history, untouched and unchanged. Beginning with the reemergence of the Palace of the Purple Emperor, the Imaskari extended their influence throughout the vacated lands and even farther. High Imaskar has been careful to break with its more sinister traditions, going so far as to abolish slavery in all forms. Yet its natural penchant for magic and its adherence to other old customs lead many to question the nation's true motives. </p><p><i>Benefit: </i>You can reroll any Arcana check, but you must keep the second result, even if it is worse. </p><p>You also know Deep Speech as an additional language. </p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Player's Guide, page(s) 104. </p>",
