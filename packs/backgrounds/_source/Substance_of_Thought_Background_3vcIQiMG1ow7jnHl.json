			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Racial </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Genasi, Psionic </p><p>A small number of genasi philosophers do not subscribe to well-known psionics origin theories. Instead, they speculate that the essence of thought might have originated in the Elemental Chaos, manifesting in the material world like all other elemental power. By subscribing to this view, do you perceive psionics as a means of establishing closer ties to the surging chaos reflected by the natural world? Or do you embrace it as a kind of primal energy-endless and all-encompassing as it threads through every living thing? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, Nature </p><p>Published in Psionic Power, page(s) 123. </p>",
