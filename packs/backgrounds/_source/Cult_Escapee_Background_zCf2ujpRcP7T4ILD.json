But when you saw how dark their grand design was, you escaped. What drew you to the cult in the first place, and what caused you to spurn it? Who was in the cult: your friends, your family, your whole community? Are they hunting you still? </p><p>Good Background: Tiefling. </p><p><i>Benefit: </i>You add Arcana and Bluff to your class skill list, and you gain a +1 bonus to Arcana and Bluff checks. </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 366, page(s) 58. </p>",
