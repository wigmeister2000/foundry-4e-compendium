			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Occupation </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Follower of Ioun </p><p>You were a respected field agent of the Collectors, following the trail of lost knowledge, identifying likely ruins for later excavation, and wresting knowledge from those who would hoard or misuse it. Then you uncovered information that rocked the foundations of your beliefs in the Collectors and their mission. Unable to reconcile the information you found with your experiences as a chronicler, you resigned from the order to search for the truth. What did you find out about the Collectors? Do you reveal this information to those you meet, or do you hold it tight and secret against the dictates of Ioun? Does anyone else know what you do, and if so, what has happened to them? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Insight, Streetwise </p><p>Associated Languages: Abyssal </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 385, page(s) 80. </p>",
