			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Racial </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Minotaur </p><p>Your clan once turned from the demon lord Baphomet to embrace the Philosophy of the Labyrinth. Yet destructive forces thrive, working relentlessly to bring the world to ruin. If left unchecked, you know they shall succeed. This is inevitable. You left your home to seek out evil and annihilate it. Perhaps you do this out of conscience, honor, vengeance, or out of shame for your savage heritage. Or maybe you do it to appease the bloodthirsty beast lurking within your soul. Perhaps you do it because your race is more capable for the task than others, and the task must be done. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Intimidate, Perception </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 385, page(s) 21. </p>",
