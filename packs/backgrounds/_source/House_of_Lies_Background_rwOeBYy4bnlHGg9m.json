Maybe it's one of the famous names. Maybe it's a minor family. Maybe your ancestry is so mixed up you can trace your bloodline to a dozen houses. When asked, you tend to pick a noble house as the mood suits you, and sometimes you make one up on the spot just to sound impressive. </p><p>Do you want to learn your true ancestry? How would you react if your true ancestry were established? Are you hiding something by lying about you family line? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Bluff, History </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook Races: Tiefling, page(s) 8. </p>",
