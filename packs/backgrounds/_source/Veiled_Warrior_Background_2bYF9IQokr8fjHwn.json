To ensure that the secret doors to those realms remain hidden, the eladrin dispatch spies and watchers into the mortal world. You are one of these veiled warriors, and it is your duty to study mortal affairs-and, when you can, to act against those whose defiling or recklessness puts your homeland at risk. Whom do you serve? What enemies do you oppose to keep your home safe? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Nature, Stealth </p><p>Published in Dark Sun Campaign Setting, page(s) 26. </p>",
