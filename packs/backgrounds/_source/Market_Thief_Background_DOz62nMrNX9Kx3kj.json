Your tribe roamed from village to village, establishing a short-lived elven market wherever it pitched its tents. Were you a pickpocket or burglar, preying on the dull-witted locals? Were you an entertainer who distracted the crowds so that other elves could steal from them? Does your tribe still wander from place to place, or did some disaster befall the group, sending you out into the world alone? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Streetwise, Thievery </p><p>Published in Dark Sun Campaign Setting, page(s) 26. </p>",
