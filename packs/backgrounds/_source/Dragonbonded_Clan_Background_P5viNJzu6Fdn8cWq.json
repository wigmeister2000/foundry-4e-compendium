			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Racial </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Dragonborn </p><p>Your clan is still bonded to the service of a dragon, just as it was before the rise of Arkhosia. Your people do not live among other races, but in the remote wilderness near your patron dragon's lair. The ways of other races and their civilizations are foreign to you, and to their eyes you might seem barbaric or uncultured. Why have you left your close-knit clan, and its service to your dragon patron? Or do you perhaps adventure in service to that patron? Is your patron benevolent, or cruel and domineering? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, Intimidate </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook Races: Dragonborn, page(s) 9. </p>",
