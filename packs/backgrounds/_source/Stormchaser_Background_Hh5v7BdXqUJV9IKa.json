However, your connection to elemental power is stronger than that, letting you shape that power and unleash it as you hunt. </p><p>How does your status as a stormchaser affect your relationship with your kin? Are storm-homes common in your native land, making you only one of countless wilden imbued with such power? Or is the power of the storm a rare and legendary thing among your community? Does your power set you on the path to greatness and mark you as one possessed of the full fury of nature? Or do your people view your elemental power as a weakness which dilutes the purity of your Feywild essence? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, Endurance </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 393. </p>",
