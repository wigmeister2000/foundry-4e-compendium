			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Racial </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Dragonborn </p><p>Your clan was enslaved by the tiefling rulers of Bael Turath, among the earliest casualties of that empire's clash with Arkhosia. They endured heinous treatment, horrible punishments, and perhaps even magical experimentation at the hands of their warlock masters. You might bear the scars of this ancient oppression-perhaps an unusually small stature, maybe a ready obedience and docile temperament, or possibly an inclination toward the sinister magic of your clan's former masters. You might seek to win glory to prove yourself better than your slave ancestors, or you might not seek glory at all. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, Streetwise </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook Races: Dragonborn, page(s) 9. </p>",
