The echo planes-the Feywild and the Shadowfell-are not entirely cut off from the spirits' power, but the spirits are much weaker there, where other powers hold sway. You are native to the Feywild, where arcane magic courses through every leaf and blade of grass. You always felt an affinity for and a sensitivity to that magic, a constant awareness of its hum through the wild places of your home. Then you visited the world, and your ear naturally listened for the same vibrant hum. You found it, but it was different-it was the song of the primal spirits. You found that you could naturally communicate with those spirits and call on their power. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, Nature </p><p>Published in Primal Power, page(s) 135. </p>",
