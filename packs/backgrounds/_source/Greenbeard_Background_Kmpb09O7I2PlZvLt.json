While the fomorians drove most of your shield kin from their dank halls, you are more at home under the shadowy canopy of the deep forest. You are unmatched in ferocity and the skill of the hunt, and ensure the dark fey pay mightily for each square inch of Winterglen they conquer. </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 376, page(s) 62. </p>",
