			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Geography </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Dark Sun </p><p>You belong to an elemental cult or a priesthood, a secret society that teaches reverence for the primal power sleeping in the world's sand, stone, and sky. Perhaps you were brought to a hidden shrine as a child and raised there, or you might have met a wandering teacher or half-mad seer who tutored you in the power of the elements. Does your order have a high purpose, such as the restoration of Athas or the destruction of the sorcerer-kings? Does your order still exist, or are you the last member? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Nature, Perception </p><p>Published in Dark Sun Campaign Setting, page(s) 182. </p>",
