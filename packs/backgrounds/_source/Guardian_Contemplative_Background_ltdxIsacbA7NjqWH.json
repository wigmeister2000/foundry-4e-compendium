Words hold power over emotions. Against ignorance, knowledge cuts sharper than any blade. The arm wields the axe, but the mind, spirit, and voice can control far mightier weapons. How does your clan view your choice? Do they respect your power or condemn you for weakness? Are you favored by the gods or feared as a practitioner of black magic? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, Religion </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 385, page(s) 21. </p>",
