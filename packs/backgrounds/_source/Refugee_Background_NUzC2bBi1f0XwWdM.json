Were you forced to take up a seminomadic existence, moving from town to town and looking for a new place to finally call home? Did you end up in a ghetto or refugee camp in another nation? How did you survive those willing to prey upon the weak and helpless who have nowhere else to go? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Endurance, Stealth </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 392. </p>",
