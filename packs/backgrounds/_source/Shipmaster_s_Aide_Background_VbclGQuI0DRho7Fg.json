			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Adventurers </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Forgotten Realms </p><p>When you were young, your parents encouraged you to learn a trade in the shipbuilding industry. You were apprenticed to a shipmaster, a great craftsman of renown in Imdolphyn. The master taught you much about ship construction, engineering, and sailing, but you always had dreams of actually leaving the port and working on your own terms. One night, you decided that you'd had enough of this \"mundane\" life, and set out on your own to gather tales of lands beyond to tell your hopelessly provincial family and friends. </p><p>Recommended Feat: Imdolphyn Dockhaunt </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Athletics, History </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 376, page(s) 49. </p>",
