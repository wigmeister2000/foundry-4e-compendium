			"value":"<p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p>You were born when, by all rights, such a birth should have been impossible, making you either a blessing or a curse for your surprised parents. Since a young age, you have been told that you owe your existence to the forces of luck, and you have developed a keen understanding of how chance conspires to influence reality. Perhaps your parents were old, or maybe you were born despite a hex against your bloodline. Perhaps a prophecy predicted your death but, unlike all the others, you survived. </p><p>Why was your birth such a quirk of fate? Is there a purpose to your birth, or do you seem to beat the odds wherever you go? Has your origin led you to question the odds, or do you fear you've used up all your luck just by being born? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Insight, Religion </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 388. </p>",
