Your job was to catalog, collate, and analyze all the information ound in various sources: tattered tomes, precise military orders, or hastily scribbled notes inked in a spy's own blood. What was the most incendiary information you saw while researching in the Tower of Memory, and under what conditions would you reveal it? What was the key piece of information that you were unable to find for your masters? Might a more direct approach obtain the missing secret? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, History </p><p>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 156. </p>",
