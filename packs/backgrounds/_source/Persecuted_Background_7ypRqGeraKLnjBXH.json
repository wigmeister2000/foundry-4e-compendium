Was it because of your race or faith? Was it because of your power source? Was that regime always in place, or was it a recent development? Perhaps you adventure in hopes of finding the means to topple the authorities that persecute you and your kind. Or maybe you're searching for a haven or sanctuary, so you can lead those like you to a new, welcoming home. </p><p>To survive, you learned to hide your true identity or heritage and to notice when someone might be tracking you. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Bluff, Perception </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 386, page(s) 68. </p>",
