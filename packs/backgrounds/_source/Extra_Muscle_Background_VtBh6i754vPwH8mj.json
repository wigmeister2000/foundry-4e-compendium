You learned to negotiate the ins and outs not only of physical protection and security of your boss, but also intrigues and \"fine negotiations.\" Having seen the \"good life\" and its consequences up close, you decided that you'd take some of your skills and apply them in another way, becoming an adventurer. Hopefully, your old boss won't hold a grudge . . . </p><p>Recommended Feat: Tarn-Trader Bodyguard </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Athletics, Insight </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 376, page(s) 47. </p>",
