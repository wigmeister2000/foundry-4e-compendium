			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Racial </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Thri-kreen race </p><p>You have a strong tie to the Ancestral Khanate. You might have a particularly good memory and recall events that you did not witness. Occasionally, the ancestors could speak through you, imparting cryptic truths. It's likely you have a magical power, whether arcane, divine, primal, or psionic. You are expected to be an exemplar and a teacher among your people, to honor and share your gifts. How do you take this duty? Why did you set out from your pack into the wider world? Did you anger the khan or another dominant pack mate? Have the ancestors given you a greater purpose? Can you share this goal with others or is it a secret you keep? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>History, Nature </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 411. </p>",
