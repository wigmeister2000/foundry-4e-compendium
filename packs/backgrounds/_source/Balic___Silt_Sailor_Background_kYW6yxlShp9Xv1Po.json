Traveling the Sea of Silt is dangerous-you have fought off giants and silt horrors and endured terrible dust storms. Why did you leave your last ship? Do you hope to buy your own vessel someday? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Athletics, Streetwise </p><p>Associated Languages: Giant </p><p>Published in Dark Sun Campaign Setting, page(s) 144. </p>",
