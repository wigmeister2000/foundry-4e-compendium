			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Racial </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Dragonborn </p><p>You come from a dishonored dragonborn clan. Whether recently or in the distant past, an individual or a family in your clan did something so cowardly, dishonorable, or incompetent that it reflected poorly on the entire clan. Perhaps a group of soldiers deserted the field before a key battle between Arkhosia and Bael Turath. Maybe a sorcerer of your clan destroyed an entire enclave with a miscast spell or botched ritual. Or a warlock made an infernal pact, treated with devils, and joined forces with the empire of Bael Turath. Other dragonborn, if they know your clan name, assume that you're prone to the same failings, blame you for the actions of your clanmate, or simply taunt you because of your unfortunate heritage. How do you respond to such a reception? Do you hide your clan affiliation, or have you renounced it entirely? Or do you seek to earn such glory that your deeds overshadow those that brought shame to your clan? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>History, Streetwise </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook Races: Dragonborn, page(s) 8. </p>",
