Magic items, magical lore, magical secrets-you value these more than gold. </p><p>More than any other form of payment, you want an artifact. Gaining an artifact is your goal. You might even have a specific artifact in mind. </p><p>You recognize that artifacts, as magical quasientities with temperaments and goals all their own, cannot be bought and sold by gold. That knowledge only stokes your burning desire to possess one. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Diplomacy, History </p><p>Published in Arcane Power, page(s) 159. </p>",
