What was that hero known for? Do you feel called to emulate your namesake's great deeds, or are you driven to make a name for yourself in a different way? Do you ever dream of your ancestor, or have feelings of déjà vu, as if you're walking in that hero's footsteps? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Diplomacy, History </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 181. </p>",
