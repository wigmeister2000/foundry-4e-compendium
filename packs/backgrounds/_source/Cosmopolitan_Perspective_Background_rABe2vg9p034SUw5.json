			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Racial </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Thri-Kreen race, Psionic </p><p>Your burgeoning psionic abilities caused you to unwittingly tap into the collected minds of other psionics users. After that initial exposure, you found yourself feeling increasingly disconnected from the traditional thri-kreen views of community. Do you still find it hard to trust others, instinctively viewing those you meet as either predator or prey? Or have such instincts fallen by the wayside for you? Are you openly accepted by the folk of other races? Or does your monstrous appearance continue to inspire a mistrust that you must struggle to overcome? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Diplomacy, Streetwise </p><p>Published in Psionic Power, page(s) 123. </p>",
