Your parents or caretakers quickly noticed, however, that something was amiss. Your newborn eyes gleamed with awareness, the first sign that you possessed the intellect of a full-grown adult. You learned to speak within hours, and you started walking as soon as your muscles could support your weight. You proved to be a prodigy in nearly every discipline. </p><p>Your awakened mind gave you advantages over your peers, but your incredible intelligence proved disconcerting to youngsters and adults alike. Did you try to fit in, or did you abandon your peers' petty concerns and embrace your destiny? How have your childhood experiences influenced your interactions with others? What advantages did you gain from your early development? What events from that time still haunt you? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Bluff, Intimidate </p><p>Published in Psionic Power, page(s) 120. </p>",
