			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Racial </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Drow </p><p>You never saw the lightless depths beneath the earth as a place of death and unmoving stone. To your eyes, it teemed with life- not just the life of fungi and crawling things, but the whispers of the Deep Winds and other primal spirits. Even the terrible spider symbol of Lolth you saw as an echo of the Fate Weaver, a being of far greater wisdom than the dread and demented Spider Queen. Your beliefs and strange behavior earned you exile from your home city, but you didn't mind much-you always felt more at home in the wild caverns anyway. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Dungeoneering, Nature </p><p>Published in Primal Power, page(s) 135. </p>",
