			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Campaign </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Forgotten Realms </p><p>Trade has collapsed along the Great Road, leaving the defenders of Yeshelmaar as the last bastion of civilization in the Great Dale. Demons that were bound beneath the Dunwood by the long-fallen Empire of Narfell now stalk the northern forest and threaten to overwhelm the wild reaches of the Forest of Lethyr. The southern woods are home to hidden wood elf villages and a handful of human settlements along the border with Thesk. </p><p><i>Benefit: </i>You add Arcana and Nature to your class skill list, and you gain a +1 bonus to Arcana checks and Nature checks. </p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Player's Guide, page(s) 102. </p>",
