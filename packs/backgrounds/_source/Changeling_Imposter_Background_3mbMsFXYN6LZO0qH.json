Although you can assume any appearance you choose, you find yourself drawn to another's identity so much that you replace the individual. What draws you to impersonation? What tricks have you developed to deflect suspicion? How long do you borrow this identity and are you responsible or reckless with the life you steal? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Bluff, Streetwise </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 388. </p>",
