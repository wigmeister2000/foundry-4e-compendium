A thoughtsinger weaves dreams for his or her audience, projecting her creations directly into the mind and heart. Instead of the sound of music, you share memories of joy and sorrow. If you are a thoughtsinger of hashalaq heritage, you might choose to specialize in diplomacy and deception, but if you are a tsucora thoughtsinger, you could prey on the doubts and fears of your foes. As you weave dreams, do you choose to do so with finesse and a light touch, or do you prefer to overwhelm your audience? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Diplomacy, Insight </p><p>Associated Languages: Quori </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 385, page(s) 15. </p>",
