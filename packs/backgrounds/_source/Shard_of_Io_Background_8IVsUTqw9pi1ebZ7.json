			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Racial </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Dragonborn </p><p>The divine power you wield is a tiny fragment of Io's own power-a mote of divine light that emerged from the dying god, escaped the clutches of both Bahamut and Tiamat as they rose from Io's corpse and claimed his mantle, and lay dormant until it could finally come to rest-in you. Perhaps it was safeguarded by an angel, awaiting the proper time for it to come to light in a great mortal champion. Or it might have been claimed by a dragonborn invoker who passed it down through countless centuries, until your dying master passed it on to you. Perhaps it has been hidden in your bloodline, passed through generations, and perhaps it remains dormant until you manage to awaken it fully. Whatever the case, you are the custodian of tremendous divine power-power that many others would dearly love to claim. </p><p>This is a great background for an invoker who isn't just a student of the ancient ways, but a literal heir of ancient power. Consider working toward the Avatar of Io epic destiny (see page 32), but every divine power you use throughout your career is a manifestation of Io's spark in you. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>History, Religion </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook Races: Dragonborn, page(s) 14. </p>",
