Many fear he will claim the entire court and all the winter fey as his own. Those who come into his service are called the wintertouched, because they are his thralls. For a time, you served the Lord of the Longest Night, but you somehow threw off his bonds. What drew you into his service? What missions did you undertake? Why did you quit? Did a single event lead to this decision? If so, what was it? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, Stealth </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 384, page(s) 62. </p>",
