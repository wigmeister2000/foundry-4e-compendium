			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Geography </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Dark Sun </p><p>You grew up in one of the tiny villages hidden among the mudflats of the remote coasts. Most Athasians fear silt and won't venture in deeper than their ankles, but you grew up around the stuff. You balance on stilts as easily as other people balance on sandals, and you have a feel for which silt is safe to wade and which should be avoided. Life in the mudflat villages is simple and primitive compared to life in the Tablelands or the Seven Cities; what do you make of the world beyond your home? Do you hope to return to your village someday? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Acrobatics, Nature </p><p>Associated Languages: Giant </p><p>Published in Dark Sun Campaign Setting, page(s) 179. </p>",
