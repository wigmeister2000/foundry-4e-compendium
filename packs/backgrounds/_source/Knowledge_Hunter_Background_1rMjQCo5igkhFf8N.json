			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Racial </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Thri-kreen race </p><p>Thri-kreen recognize that knowledge is power. Belief in the Ancestral Khanate gives the gathering of knowledge a greater importance to thri-kreen as a people. Everything the thri-kreen learn continues to exist as part of the ancestral consciousness. A few thri-kreen take this fact deeply to heart, pursuing esoteric understanding as a way to strengthen their people. Upon learning hidden facts, such hunters usually share what they know. Knowledge hunters are also the likeliest thri-kreen to be truly philosophical or artistic. Why have you become a knowledge hunter? What have you learned so far? Where might these rumors and tidbits lead you? Have you learned something that puts you or your pack in danger? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, Dungeoneering </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 411. </p>",
