After spending years under their oppressive yoke toiling below Harglast, you escaped into the catacombs, eventually finding your way back to the surface. Armed with the knowledge gained from living with your torturous captors, you have decided to use your expertise to your advantage. One day, you might return to your place of captivity to bring justice to the vile beings that took away years of your life. </p><p>Recommended Feat: Harglastan Catacomb Delver </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Dungeoneering, Endurance </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 376, page(s) 49. </p>",
