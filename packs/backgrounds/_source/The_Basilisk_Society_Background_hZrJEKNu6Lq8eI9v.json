			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Origin </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p>You fled when you learned the hidden purpose behind Basilisk, the secret society to which you belonged. Basilisk swore to bring down tyranny and place rulership justly in the hands of the people. But their secret leader, an ash nymph known as the Golden Mistress, runs a criminal cartel to bring about the downfall of civilization so that it can be reclaimed by nature. She will not let you escape because she gave you her blessing-her true kiss of trust. You know too much, and now you must be reclaimed or silenced. In cities, she hunts you with assassins and thugs; in nature, she hounds you with wild beasts and fey. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Nature, Streetwise </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 389, page(s) 6. </p>",
