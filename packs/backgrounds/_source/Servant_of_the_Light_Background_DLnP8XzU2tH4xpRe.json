			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Racial </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Kalashtar </p><p>The renegade quori were driven from Dal Quor because of their faith in the Path of Light, and their belief that the Darkness That Dreams can be replaced by il-Yannah, the Great Light. This faith continues to drive you to this day. If you are a Duulora avenger, you strike with righteous fury borne from your faith, and if you are a hashalaq cleric or paladin, you use charisma and diplomacy to inspire mortals to turn away from darkness. When it comes to battle, psychic power and the radiant force of il-Yannah combine within you to make you a fearsome foe. How can you reflect both aspects of your culture? Are you a kalashtar ardent who falls upon training as a paladin to ref lect your faith? Or have you recently discovered the need to find and destroy those who oppose the light? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, Religion </p><p>Associated Languages: Quori </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 385, page(s) 14. </p>",
