What use is it to be free when the tyrants will just scoop up another people and subject them to the same evils? You commit yourself to eternal war against the ones that bred your race, naming drow (mind flayers, sorcerer-kings, derro, or something else) as your paramount foes. Can you show mercy to these people? If so, under what circumstance? To what extent will you go to fight them? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Dungeoneering, History </p><p>Associated Languages: Deep Speech, Draconic, Elven, Giant </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 391. </p>",
