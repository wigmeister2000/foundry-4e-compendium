			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Geography </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Eberron </p><p>Although part of the nation of Breland, Sharn is a society in its own right. People and cultures of nearly every imaginable sort are brought together there. They talk, they do business, they travel together, they pass one another on the street, and the result is a true melting pot, perhaps the only one in all the Five Nations. Members of monstrous or disfavored races who aren't welcomed in Sharn's towers can find a place in the shadows deep beneath the lofty spires and floating towers that give the City of Towers its title. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Insight, Streetwise </p><p>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 126. </p>",
