			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Campaign </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Forgotten Realms </p><p>A mire of despair, Luskan is a city of rotting buildings and filth-choked streets. Corpses lie where they fall, and packs of starving dogs prey on the living and the dead. For too long, aggressive villains have exploited the chaos of the city, enforcing their whims and taking what they wanted from its feeble population, while abominations from the great wilderness made slaves of the survivors. However, no one rules Luskan for long. The vile citizens always rise up from the slop to pull down anyone who reaches too far, preferring the squalor of their existence to the faint shred of hope promised by yet another feckless lord. </p><p><i>Benefit: </i>You add Stealth and Thievery to your class skill list, and you gain a +1 bonus to Stealth checks and Thievery checks. </p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Player's Guide, page(s) 110. </p>",
