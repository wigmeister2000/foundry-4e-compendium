You cannot help but dream of those bygone days. What sort of ruler was your ancestor . . . according to your family and according to the history books? Are there particular qualities of your ancestor that you're eager to emulate, or perhaps repudiate? Do you entertain dreams of ruling an empire yourself someday? </p><p>Good Background: Tiefling. </p><p><i>Benefit: </i>You add History to your class skill list, and you gain a +3 bonus to History checks. </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 366, page(s) 57. </p>",
