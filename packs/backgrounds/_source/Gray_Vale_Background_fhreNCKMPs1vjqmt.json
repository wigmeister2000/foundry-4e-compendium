			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Campaign </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Forgotten Realms </p><p>Gray Vale has grown into a trade center in the North in large part due to the success of Loudwater. This small town has an advantageous location at the confluence of the Delimbiyr and Grayflow rivers. Rich and arable farmland enables the community to thrive. Most merchants in the vicinity use the river to transport goods, making Loudwater an ideal nexus for nearly all commerce in this part of the world. </p><p>Although Loudwater and other small settlements enjoy some prosperity, the threat of danger checks their growth. Displaced savages from beyond the High Forest are a constant peril. Goblins infest the Southwood, snatching cattle, supplies, and the occasional child before retreating to the dim shelter of their foreboding forest. Whispers of Najaran serpentfolk fill the taprooms as locals peer suspiciously at strangers, ever watchful for these sinister infiltrators. All of these dangers and more cast a pall of fear and mistrust over Gray Vale. </p><p><i>Benefit: </i>You gain one additional language of your choice, you add Nature to your class skill list, and you gain a +2 bonus to Nature checks. </p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Player's Guide, page(s) 100. </p>",
