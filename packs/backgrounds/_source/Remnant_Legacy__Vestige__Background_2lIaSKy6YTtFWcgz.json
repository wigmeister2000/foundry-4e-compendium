You might feel a connection to places or events your vestige touched in life. Do you strive to live up to their example or to atone for terrible acts? Perhaps you experience moments of déjà vu and question whether it is your own life you're living and not that of the vestiges. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, History </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 381, page(s) 54. </p>",
