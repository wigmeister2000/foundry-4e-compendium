			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Racial </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Tiefling </p><p>Mercenary isn't quite the right word. It sounds too formal, too militaristic. No, you worked for a living, and as ugly as that work got, it put food on the table and coins in your purse. Your life as a hired sword wasn't easy-and you have the scars to prove it-yet those who crossed you always got the worse end of the bargain. </p><p>Why was fighting for money the best way to make a living? Are you still for hire? Did your work earn you a reputation, and is it one you welcome or regret? What kinds of jobs did you take-pushing around merchants, shadowy bodyguard work for a spoiled noble, or something much worse? Were there jobs you wouldn't take? Does anyone still owe you pay? Did you make any enemies while working for others' interests? </p><p>Sellsword is a good background for fighters and warlords, but as a ranger or rogue your employment might have put you in more secretive roles. Perhaps instead of a soldier you were a scout, or rather than an armed guard you acted as a plainclothes bodyguard. </p><p>Consider feats that emphasize your history as someone who lived by the blade. Nimble Blade, Quick Draw, and Toughness might be good choices. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Heal, Perception </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook Races: Tiefling, page(s) 16. </p>",
