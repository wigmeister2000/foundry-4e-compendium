			"value":"<p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p>You once had an undeniable talent for magic. You took to your arcane lessons and studied carefully, fascinated by magic. Then, pushed to prove your abilities to yourself or your tutor, you tried to use a spell or a ritual that was beyond your skill. The attempt went disastrously wrong, and you invoked a powerful curse that suppressed or abolished your ability to perform even the simplest spell. You became determined to restore your power or find a new kind of prowess, so you resolved to make your way in the world through wit and weapon. You are now a master at what you do, yet you can't help but feel that something is missing. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, Endurance </p><p>Published in Martial Power 2, page(s) 153. </p>",
