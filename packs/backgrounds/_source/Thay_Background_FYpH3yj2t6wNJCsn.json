			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Campaign </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Forgotten Realms </p><p>Hardship and deprivation define existence in Thay. Undead roam the land, twitching legions of rotten flesh that wait for the day when the lich-lord sends them forth in the name of conquest. Slavers prowl ruined cities, searching for fresh meat to sell on the auction blocks, while roaming bands of gnolls scour the rugged countryside for sacrifices to offer up to their masters. </p><p><i>Benefit: </i>Add the higher of your Intelligence score or your Constitution score to your starting hit points (instead of automatically adding your Constitution score). Your number of healing surges is still based on your Constitution score. </p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Player's Guide, page(s) 122. </p>",
