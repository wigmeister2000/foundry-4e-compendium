How did you end up with such ties? Perhaps invaders destroyed your family or your home, forcing you to flee to the Feywild. Did the eladrin take you in? It is possible that you have never lived among other elves. Why did you leave the Feywild? Were you cast out, or did you strike out on your own to see the world? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, Insight </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 181. </p>",
