			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Racial </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Tiefling </p><p>You are plagued by nightmarish visions that haunt your sleep. In your dreams, you have vivid glimpses of the Nine Hells and the torments they offer, as well as of the splendor of Asmodeus's palace and the luxurious lives of his most favored servants. What message do you take from these visions? What connection, if any, do you feel to the Nine Hells and their denizens? Does some infernal patron want something from you, or is some divine force reminding you of the punishment you risk if you stray from the path of righteousness? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Bluff, Religion </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 183. </p>",
