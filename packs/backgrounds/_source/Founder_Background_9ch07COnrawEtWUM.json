You might have helped to plan the settlement, or you might have spent some time laying bricks with your own two hands. Was the process part of a simpler life, or was it a prelude to your adventuring career? Did you learn to do battle while patrolling its half-constructed walls? A town with your own personal stamp on it might serve as a worthy base of operations, and its people might clamor for your protection. </p><p>When was the last time you were there? What was once a small but promising settlement might now be a thriving city-or a ghost town. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Athletics, History </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 387, page(s) 61. </p>",
