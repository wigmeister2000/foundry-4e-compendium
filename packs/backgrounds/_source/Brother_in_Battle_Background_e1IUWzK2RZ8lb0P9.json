			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Campaign </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Scales of War Adventure Path </p><p>Not everyone needs to be chased across the world by black-cloaked assassins. You crave fighting, beer-drinking, and companionship of either the friendly or the romantic sort. Have you always had such simple desires, or did you come to this simplicity after years spent striving for something more esoteric? Are there particular enemies you relish fighting-or particular brands of ale you savor? </p><p>Good Background: Dwarf. </p><p><i>Benefit: </i>You add Endurance to your class skill list, and you gain a +3 bonus to Endurance checks. </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 366, page(s) 55. </p>",
