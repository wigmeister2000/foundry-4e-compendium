The southern Dales have fallen under the sway of Sembia as that merchant kingdom continues its gradual, yet relentless, expansion northward. </p><p><i>Benefit: </i>You can reroll any Nature check, but you must keep the second result, even if it is worse. </p><p>You also gain a +1 bonus on initiative checks </p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Player's Guide, page(s) 90. </p>",
