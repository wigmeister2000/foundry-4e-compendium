			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Campaign </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Eberron </p><p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Follower of the Traveler </p><p>Those who truly devote themselves to the ways of the Traveler roam the world, accomplishing such tasks as they find need doing. They manipulate their foes into disarray before striking. Their actions sometimes seem amoral, but this is often because the observer cannot see the deeds' ultimate ends. Rather than accept praise or blame, these wanderers disappear as soon as mystical whim moves them onward. How has this itinerant lifestyle affected you? What do you care about, since you have no roots? What methods do you use to determine the direction you take or deeds you do? Do you assume, like many other Traveler devotees, that your mere presence in a situation suggests you are meant to act as an instrument of change? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Bluff, Stealth </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 382, page(s) 71. </p>",
