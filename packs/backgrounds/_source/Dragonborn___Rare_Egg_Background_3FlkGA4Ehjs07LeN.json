It might have had the appearance of burnished gold, carried a pattern that resembled a significant symbol, or broken cleanly into two pieces when you emerged. How much weight do you attach to this phenomenon? What do you think it means, and what did your parents think? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, Religion </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 180. </p>",
