You could always tell when something was wrong, bond with people who liked you, and sever connections with those who meant you harm. Close friends marveled when you finished their sentences. You had a gift, a talent that revealed itself in a profound way when you came into the fullness of your psionic ability. Your childhood tricks evolved into something more, until you could almost hear people's thoughts and read their moods and emotions as if they were words on a page. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Diplomacy, Insight </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 395. </p>",
