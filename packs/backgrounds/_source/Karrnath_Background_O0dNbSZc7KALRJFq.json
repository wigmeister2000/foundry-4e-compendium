			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Geography </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Eberron </p><p>Once the strongest bastion of the Five Nations, Karrnath suffered terribly during the Last War. A proud military tradition and a drive for excellence in all aspects of life empowered Karrnath before the war. However, the reputation of its military proved false after Aundair delivered several swift defeats during the war. Karrnath used necromancy to create undead legions from its fallen soldiers, to no avail. Today, Karrnath struggles against plague and famine. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Athletics, Intimidate </p><p>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 128. </p>",
