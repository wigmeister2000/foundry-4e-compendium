			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Geography </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Dark Sun </p><p>You come from the Tamwar, nomads who live on the edge of the Endless Sand Dunes. As a youth you were chosen to learn the ways of the elemental spirits and become a holy warrior of your people. Perhaps you left your tribe to seek your fortune in the wider world, hoping to earn great wealth in the civilized lands. Or maybe you are the last of your family, the sole survivor of a dark tragedy. Are you a mercenary or a scout for hire, ready to trade your desert knowledge for a few coins at a time? What do you think of the city dwellers you meet? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>History, Nature </p><p>Published in Dark Sun Campaign Setting, page(s) 182. </p>",
