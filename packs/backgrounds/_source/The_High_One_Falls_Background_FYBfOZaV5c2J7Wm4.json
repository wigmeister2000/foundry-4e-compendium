			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Origin </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p>In a prophetic vision, the high priest of your people saw you slay the ruler of your land. Your possible future act against the person, who many believe descended from the gods, caused you to be branded a traitor. So you fled your home, narrowly escaping capture and execution. Now mercenaries and bounty hunters stalk you wherever you go with cunning traps and ambushes, each desperate to claim the royal price on your head or to protect the sovereign from harm. Did you love or hate this ruler? Was the priest's prophecy likely to come true, or were you framed? Will the path you take help to avoid this destiny or cause it to come true? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Endurance, Intimidate </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 389, page(s) 7. </p>",
