			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Racial </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Dragonborn </p><p>Passion drives you. Like many dragonborn, you experience emotion deeply-you become furious, not annoyed, and bubble over with joyous laughter when others might smile to themselves. In battle, your ferocity and enthusiasm more than make up for a certain lack of discipline, and you're more likely to rush into the fray than wait in a shield wall with your allies. Your passion rubs off on your allies, making you something of a leader figure even if that's not your combat role in game terms. It's hard not to follow where you lead, simply because you go there with such enthusiasm and commitment. </p><p>What stirs your passion for adventuring? Is it a lust for glory, a thirst for gold, or a crusading hatred of monstrous evil? Or is it simply the thrill of being out in the world, rootless and free, risking your life every day in </p><p>bloody battle? </p><p>Are you a warlord who gets your allies worked into a frenzy to improve their fighting ability? A rogue whose fervor in battle leaves your enemies off guard? A fighter who leads by example, expecting that your passion itself is contagious? Or a ranger who gets lost in the whirl of blades until the battle itself fades from your conscious awareness? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Bluff, Intimidate </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook Races: Dragonborn, page(s) 17. </p>",
