			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Adulthood </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Eberron </p><p>You refused to volunteer to fight in the Last War, and in the latter years, when many of the nations passed laws requiring service, you fled rather than be pressed into the front lines-or maybe you were a soldier at one time, but you abandoned your service. Are you still a wanted criminal, or has your home region offered amnesty for deserters? Why did you run? Was it cowardice or a moral objection to the battle? If you risked imprisonment to avoid violence, then why did you become an adventurer? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Endurance, Bluff </p><p>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 158. </p>",
