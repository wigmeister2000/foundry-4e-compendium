			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Campaign </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Forgotten Realms </p><p>Five wealthy and powerful merchant houses control Amn. These so-called High Houses form the governing Council of Five, which has complete authority over the nation and keeps a close check on all mercantile and military activity. Through the efforts of the council, Amn has amassed a formidable fleet of ships to guard and transport goods across western Faer√ªn. </p><p>Amn is widely disliked, but it has avoided major conflicts through a combination of scheming, intimidation, and pragmatism. Many foreign nobles and merchants have made fortunes through dealings with Amn. It is a land where luck counts for little, and where shrewdness and acumen determine one's success and survival. </p><p><i>Benefit: </i>You add Streetwise and Thievery to your class skill list, and you gain a +1 bonus to Streetwise checks and Thievery checks. </p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Player's Guide, page(s) 80. </p>",
