When you came of age, you pulled up stakes and left everyone and everything you knew. Is fate drawing you toward a particular location or individual, or is the unconscious pull you feel compelling you to fulfill some inscrutable purpose? Are you traveling to escape something, perhaps to overcome a loss, a conflict, or a humiliation? Whatever your reason, you do not or cannot put down roots. Before you run the risk of settling into any particular place, you pick up and move on again. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Nature, Perception </p><p>Published in Psionic Power, page(s) 121. </p>",
