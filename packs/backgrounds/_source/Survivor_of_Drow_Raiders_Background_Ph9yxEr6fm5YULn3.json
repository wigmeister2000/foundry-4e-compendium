			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Society </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p>Your life was comparatively peaceful before the night of fire and death, when a drow raiding party in search of treasure and slaves boiled out of a hole in the ground and destroyed everything you held dear. Shortly thereafter, agents from the House of Flowers contacted you and took you in as a trainee. Were you overlooked during the drow attack, or did you fight to freedom? Were any of your friends or family captured in the raid? Do you hate the drow, or have put your hatred behind you? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, Religion </p><p>Associated Languages: Elven </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 386, page(s) 65. </p>",
