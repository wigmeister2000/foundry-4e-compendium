Did you work for a thieves' guild as an enforcer, or did you fight to repel those same thugs from your neighborhood? How did you come across your fighting skills? Were you taught by an aging master, or did you learn it the hard way? How do you view these activities now? Do you have a grudge against criminals and take on quests to put bandits down? Or is there bad blood between you and your former associates? You have learned to remain unseen when pursued and to stand your ground when you have nowhere to turn. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Intimidate, Stealth </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 390. </p>",
