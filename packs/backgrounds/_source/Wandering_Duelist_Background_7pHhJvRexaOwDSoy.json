How did you learn your initial training in the combat arts? Why haven't you resorted to out-and-out banditry? What places have you visited in your wandering? What would it take for you to settle down? </p><p>Good Background: Dragonborn. </p><p><i>Benefit: </i>You add Intimidate to your class skill list and give yourself a +3 bonus to Intimidate checks. </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 366, page(s) 54. </p>",
