You are the lone survivor of a mystic enclave that possessed a terrible secret. The only way you have found to avoid those who might try to seize the knowledge you have is to keep moving, always just ahead of your pursuers. You use your allies among the primal spirits to help you stay one step ahead of your enemies. However, it's a hard life always being on the move, and you wonder how long you can keep it up. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, Streetwise </p><p>Published in Primal Power, page(s) 134. </p>",
