			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Racial </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Wilden </p><p>You were born in a place of defilement, where the corruption issuing from the Far Realm tainted the natural order. You might have been born to wilden parents, or simply emerged from the dying plant life at the edges of the spreading taint. Perhaps you hope to return there and purge that place of its corruption when your power is great enough. Or perhaps there is no hope for it, and you can strive only to prevent such catastrophes from occurring elsewhere. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, Nature </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 15. </p>",
