			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Campaign </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Forgotten Realms </p><p>The past century saw several smaller forests merge into the Glimmerwood. Although the cities of Everlund, Silverymoon, and Sundabar remain strong and united, dwarven allies of old have withdrawn. The boundaries around Luruar have changed as well, with the formation of the orc nation of Many-Arrows to the north, the opening of the elven kingdom of Evereska to the south, and the expansion of Netheril to the east. </p><p><i>Benefit: </i>You can reroll any History check, but you must keep the second result, even if it is worse. </p><p>You also gain one additional language of your choice. </p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Player's Guide, page(s) 108. </p>",
