You see yourself as just such a force of nature, prowling across the world and visiting your fury and rightful wrath on those who deserve it and perhaps even sometimes on those who do not. No one can say which way it might go because you are like a living, breathing natural disaster. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Intimidate, Stealth </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 388. </p>",
