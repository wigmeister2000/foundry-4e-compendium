			"value":"<p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p>The Temple of Reason recruits initiates from the city's youth by scooping up preadolescents to mold their beliefs and attitudes about religion and make them valued servants in the order. You were such a child. Alongside your peers, you studied the teachings of the Shining Light (Erathis or some other god). The adventurer's life offered an escape from temple duties. You might be a heretic, driven out for radical views. You could be a temple agent who ventured into the surrounding lands to bring reason and light to the world. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Insight, Religion </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 392. </p>",
