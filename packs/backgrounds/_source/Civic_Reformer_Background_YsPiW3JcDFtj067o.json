			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Society </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p>You study Nerathi lore, learning from the past to better the future. Perhaps you're inspired by great works of Nerathi literature or art, finding universal truths in their ancient expression. Maybe you marvel at the ruins of ancient Nerathi baths, forums, or roads, feeling that your homeland deserves the comforts enjoyed by your ancestors. Or maybe you're a student of the great philosopher Tallas, whose ethics guided the society which once ruled the world. Regardless of what you study, you're driven to bring this knowledge back to civilization. Be cautious though-the world's kings and nobles won't willingly surrender their authority. Thankfully, you are not alone in this search. Many cities shelter likeminded individuals who long to see their homes rise to the heights set by Nerath. Whether they are hidden societies or mobs in search of a leader, working with these groups may help you change the world. </p><p>Personal Quests: Explore Nerathi ruins for ancient lore; assist a troubled realm with your accumulated knowledge; govern justly using the ethics of Nerath. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>History, Streetwise </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 393. </p>",
