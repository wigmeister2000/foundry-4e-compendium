			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Occupation </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p>Ordinary hunters stalk deer and other game quietly, and they prefer to strike from a distance with javelin, sling, or bow. But you are no ordinary hunter. You seek the nastiest dire tiger or bulette in the area and beat it to death with your club to tenderize the meat. You might be protecting your people by driving off dangerous predators, or you might kill these monsters just to prove your strength. As a wild hunter, you are truly happy only in areas populated by dangerous prey such as mastodons and behemoths. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Athletics, Nature </p><p>Published in Primal Power, page(s) 134. </p>",
