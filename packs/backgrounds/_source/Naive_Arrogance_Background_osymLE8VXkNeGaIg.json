For you the pact is a calculated risk, and you trust to your willpower or decency to justify associating with a patron. Are you a bored debutante at play with fell magic? Perhaps you are a student of the clergy, peering into heretical lore. Are you so focused on your goals that you can rub elbows with dire entities without their evil corrupting you? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, Bluff </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 381, page(s) 54. </p>",
