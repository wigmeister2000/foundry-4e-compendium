			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Campaign </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Forgotten Realms </p><p>Baldur's Gate has seen a recent restructuring of its government. After the city nearly fell to Grand Duke Valarken and an external force of lycanthropes called the Band of the Red Moon, surviving Grand Duke Portyr instituted a parliament to better balance city power. One can hardly spend an hour in the city without seeing one or more members of the Flaming Fists. This mercenary band is so ensconced in the city that it now serves as Baldur's Gate semiofficial patrol. </p><p><i>Benefit: </i>You know one additional language of your choice, you add the Streetwise skill to your class skill list, and you gain a +2 bonus to Streetwise checks. </p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Player's Guide, page(s) 82. </p>",
