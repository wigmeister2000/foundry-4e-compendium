			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Society </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p>You have spent time on the streets collecting coin from pedestrians. Successful beggars evoke compassion from onlookers, so you have become skillful at feigning signs of disfigurement and deprivation. Your experience as a beggar has taught you to read people. You can tell whether a stranger is kindhearted or suspicious. You have learned to judge the weight of a person's purse by the way he or she walks, and you can detect the approach of a member of the watch long before the tip of the guard's halberd comes into view. In cities where thieves and beggars form guilds, you have supplemented your income by serving as a lookout on street corners where you can loiter without drawing suspicion. Your time as a beggar has given you both skills and an unquenchable thirst for wealth and status. Now you search for a way to achieve these goals. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Bluff, Insight </p><p>Published in Martial Power 2, page(s) 155. </p>",
