			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Racial </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Shifter, Psionic </p><p>You come from a clan of shifters that dwells far from civilized regions. Your people have refused to let the increasing danger of the wilds scare them off. Unlike the many shifter communities that see psionic powers as inherently evil, your clan views them as a survival tool-no better or worse than any other. That cultural acceptance must still compete with your kind's baser instincts. When your psionic abilities first manifested, did you welcome them or were you forced to fight your own fears? Once you did accept who you were, did you do so because your psionics allows you to defend your people? Or is it more important that your power grants you a measure of superiority over your peers? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Nature, Perception </p><p>Published in Psionic Power, page(s) 123. </p>",
