			"value":"<p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p>You spent ten years studying at the White Spires of Callanar where you learned to perform magic, uncovered arcane lore, and learned of the ancient traditions going back to the dawn of all worlds. You might have chosen to deepen your understanding of the arcane as much as possible, or you might have seen the sensibility of being versatile-refining your social skills for times when charm magic doesn't help you, or adding to your storehouse of knowledge about the past. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, Bluff, History </p><p>Associated Languages: Elven </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 403. </p>",
