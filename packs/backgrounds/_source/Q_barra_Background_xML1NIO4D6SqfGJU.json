			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Geography </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Eberron </p><p>A wild land of untamed frontiers extends beyond the Endworld Mountains. Here, fugitives from the Last War found an unclaimed region-at least, unclaimed by other humans, dwarves, or elves-in which they could escape the bloodshed back home. Lizardfolk, dragon born, and kobold communities can be found here. These beings have ties stretching back thousands of years and no desire to lose their lands to the mammals of the west. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Endurance, Nature </p><p>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 143. </p>",
