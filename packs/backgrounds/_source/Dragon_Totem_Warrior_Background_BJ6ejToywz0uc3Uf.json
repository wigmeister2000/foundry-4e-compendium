			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Racial </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Dragonborn </p><p>In the way that some barbarians adopt totem animals that embody the qualities they aspire to, you look to the qualities of drakes and dragons as a model for your own ferocity. You might come from a tribe of dragonborn that serves a living dragon ruler, or perhaps you venerate a long-dead dragon spirit that once ruled your ancestors. Gray dragons and cobalt dragons are the most common totem dragons for dragonborn characters, because they are the most rapacious hunters among dragonkind. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Athletics, Endurance </p><p>Published in Primal Power, page(s) 134. </p>",
