Since the eladrin held family ties to be stronger than any other consideration, some among the refugees disagreed and were loyal to Corellon, but found themselves swept up in the flight to the world. You descend from these tragic dedicates, and though your people were shamed, your family has remained loyal to Corellon these long years. How have you kept your devotion secret? Something must have led to your leaving the community. Was it a revelation about your allegiance? Or were you tired of living a lie? How has the faith of your family served them and you? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, Stealth </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 382, page(s) 69. </p>",
