Before you die, you must send a worthy offering to the dark master of your race, or you will be condemned to torment for eternity. Whether you pay your debt with wanton slaughter or seek other means of redemption is up to you. Are you selective about your victims? Do you feel remorse for your killing, or do you see it as a means to an end? How far would you go to escape the fate of your people? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Intimidate, Stealth </p><p>Published in Dark Sun Campaign Setting, page(s) 30. </p>",
