Destruction has followed you for your entire life, and the fact that you are alive seems like proof that you are being preserved for some greater purpose. Are aberrant monsters drawn to try to destroy you? Is there a widespread cult devoted to a mighty Far Realm overlord that seeks to kill you? Or is there simply a curse on you that brings death and destruction to everyone and everything you love? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Bluff, Stealth </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 15. </p>",
