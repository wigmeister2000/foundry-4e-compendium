			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Racial </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Minotaur </p><p>The voice of the beast within you is silent. Its savagery has no hold over you, and its call has no appeal. You have transcended it and moved to a higher consciousness, something akin to enlightenment. You are at peace with yourself, with who you are, and with the world around you. When you need to fight, you can fight fiercely, but you don't lose control-the beast is at your command. How did you find such peace? Was it through religious devotion, disciplined martial practice, arcane study, or psionic meditation? Is there anything that can shatter your tranquility and loose the beast again? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Diplomacy, Insight </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 11. </p>",
