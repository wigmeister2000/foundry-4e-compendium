Your skill at scavenging and your expert knowledge of the city helped your people survive. You know the markets and midden heaps alike, and your keen eyes spot things others overlook. As you adventure, look for the value in things other people ignore; are you just going to throw that potion bottle away after drinking from it? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Perception, Streetwise </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 387, page(s) 48. </p>",
