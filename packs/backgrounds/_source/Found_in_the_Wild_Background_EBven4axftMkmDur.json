			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Birth </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p>You were discovered wandering in the wilderness at a very young age, and you have little memory of your early past. You spent your youth working on a farm not far from the area where you were found. That life </p><p>might have been enough for you, for you've always felt a deep connection to the earth. However, when your new homeland was attacked by goblin raiders and its citizens were murdered, you felt a presence within your blood that called you to action, and you have been following that call ever since. </p><p>Who took you in when you were found? Was that person a loving foster parent or a cruel taskmaster? What experiences in your youth nurtured your apparently inborn connection to the primal spirits, and how has that connection flourished in your adulthood? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Heal, Streetwise </p><p>Published in Primal Power, page(s) 133. </p>",
