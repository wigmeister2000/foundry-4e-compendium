Having studied these methods, you can tease out information from the most unwilling subjects, breaking them with subtle threats and light applications of pain that build until they finally snap. Do these techniques sicken you or do you delight in the power they offer? Where did you come by this learning? Were you on the receiving end? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Bluff, Intimidate </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 388. </p>",
