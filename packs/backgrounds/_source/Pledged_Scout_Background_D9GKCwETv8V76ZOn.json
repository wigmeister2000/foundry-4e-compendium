			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Occupation </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Follower of Sehanine </p><p>You found Sehanine's teachings to your liking from an early age, and after your coming-of-age you joined the ranks of the Pledged Scouts, consummate explorers and wanderers devoted to the Moonbow. Are you specially pious, seeing omens everywhere? How did your family and friends react to your choice of career? Were you indoctrinated by another Pledged Scout, or were you a self-taught mystic? As a Pledged Scout you tend not to stay put for long. Do you have a hard time making friends, or do you leave behind a network of acquaintances that make you feel welcome whenever you return? Do you dream of one day crossing the forest paths of the Feywild, or perhaps reaching Arvandor? </p><p>You are at home in the wilderness, wondering what's over the next horizon. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Nature, Perception </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 386, page(s) 68. </p>",
