			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Adventurers </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Forgotten Realms </p><p>You had a good life in Tarmalune until the worst of all fears came to pass-a gout of fiery death delivered from the Raging Flame descended on your home, destroying it and loved ones who couldn't escape the inferno in time. You somehow made it to safety, but the Raging Flame took everything from you. Now, your passion to destroy the Raging Flame burns hotter than its destructive power. </p><p>Recommended Feat: Firequench Aspirant </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, History </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 376, page(s) 47. </p>",
