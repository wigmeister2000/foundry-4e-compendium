What worries you about the Prophecy, or what brought you to the Dragon's Path in the first place? Did you see signs of the Draconic Prophecy in your own life? Did you feel trapped by fate and want to find a way out? Is there still specific aspect of the Prophecy you try to thwart? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, History </p><p>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 158. </p>",
