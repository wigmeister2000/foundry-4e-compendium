			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Campaign </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Scales of War Adventure Path </p><p>You regard yourself as part of the natural world-but you're the part of the natural world that nurtures and protects the rest. You strive against dangers both mundane (like a rapacious woodcutter) and magical (a mysterious taint that kills vegetation by night). Why are you now an adventurer rather than still in your forest? How do you react when you're taken far from the natural world, like the heart of a city or another plane of existence? Is there a particular enemy of the forest that you're still striving against? </p><p>Good Background: Elf. </p><p><i>Benefit: </i>You add Nature and Perception to your class skill list, and you gain a +1 bonus to Nature and Perception checks. </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 366, page(s) 56. </p>",
