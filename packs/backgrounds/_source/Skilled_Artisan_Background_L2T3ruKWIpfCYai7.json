Perhaps you left the clan after striking back against the oppression of the templars or nobles, or maybe you discovered that you had no passion for the work and left to find your fortune elsewhere. What trade do your kin follow-are they armorers, stonemasons, or well diggers? Are they free or slave, poor or well-off? Why did you leave? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Insight, Streetwise </p><p>Published in Dark Sun Campaign Setting, page(s) 25. </p>",
