They manifest as voices in your head-voices that make little sense and serve only to confuse your thoughts. Are these voices real or imagined? How do you silence them? Do they sometimes make sense or are they all meaningless babble? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Insight, Intimidate </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 388. </p>",
