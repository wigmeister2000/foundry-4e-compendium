			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Campaign </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Forgotten Realms </p><p>Large pieces of Abeir fell in Chessenta, altering the landscape and setting off a series of devastating volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. Even today, much of the land remains impassable, and roads are few and far between. Chessenta ceded its western lands to the genasi of Akanûl. Nonetheless, out of crisis emerged a new, stronger Chessenta, united against a seemingly hostile world. </p><p><i>Benefit: </i>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you gain a +1 bonus to all rolls made during the extra action granted. </p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Player's Guide, page(s) 84. </p>",
