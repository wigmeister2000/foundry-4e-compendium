			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Society </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p>Your ancestors were rescued by the former Empress Amphaesia before the fall of Nerath and brought to the Feywild to dwell with her and her father, the King of Blooms. Of all the scions of Nerath, you and your kind are the most pure to the imperial legacy. You were steeped in the empire's rich culture and philosophy through a line of unbroken teachers and grandsires. From birth you've been groomed for a purpose. Perhaps that is to preserve Nerath's only living culture from agents of the Ruler of Ruin, or maybe it's to wage war against him in a final battle to restore Nerath. You may have even made a warlock pact with your fey host. </p><p>Personal Quests: Return from the Feywild and find your family's former home; earn an audience with Empress Amphaesia; unite Nerathi faithful across worlds. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, History </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 393. </p>",
