As so many halflings do, you took to exploring the world in order to find the answers to your questions, embracing new cultures in an effort to define yourself by the standards of your people. Where did your psionics come from? What does your power say about you and your obligations to your people? Even after those questions are answered, will you be able to return to your homeland? Or will the embrace of the wider world prove too hard to shake off? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Nature, Streetwise </p><p>Published in Psionic Power, page(s) 123. </p>",
