Elemental power flows through you like blood. You see the primordial forces in things in ways that others consider madness. A flash of lightning in the distance always sends a delirious thrill through your body, and when you look upon flames, your ears seem to detect the distant call of elemental beings. Does your ancestry cause you to be interested in </p><p>arcane or elemental magic, or do you abhor it because of the strange things you percieve? Are the things you see and hear when elemental forces are used around you true visions, or mere hallucinations? Do you seek the power wielded by your ancestors? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, Intimidate </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook Races: Tiefling, page(s) 8. </p>",
