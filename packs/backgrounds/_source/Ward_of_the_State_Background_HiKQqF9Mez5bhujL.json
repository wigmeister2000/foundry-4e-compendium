			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Occupation </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Follower of Erathis </p><p>Orphaned or abandoned at a young age, you spent your childhood in the care of a magistrate or some other public official. You might have been used as a living and breathing symbol of legislative compassion-whether real or phony. Do those memories still sting? Although your guardian treated you kindly enough, he or she was frequently preoccupied by matters of state. Did you feel neglected during his or her absence, or did you find it freeing? Did your guardian's world of political machinations appeal to you, or did you find it rigid and boring? </p><p>You might adventure in your guardian's name, fighting to keep the peace for a nation you grew to love. Conversely, you might adventure as a way of shaking off the monotonous memories of a stale childhood. Does your guardian approve of the life you lead? Is he or she aware of it? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Insight, Streetwise </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 387, page(s) 61. </p>",
