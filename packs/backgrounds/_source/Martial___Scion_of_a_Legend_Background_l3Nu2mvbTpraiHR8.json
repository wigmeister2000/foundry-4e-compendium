			"value":"<p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p>You have spent your life in the shadow of your mother's or father's martial reputation. You might be the latest descendant in a long line of legendary warriors, or you could be the offspring of a hero who rose to fame through recent deeds. Your parent might be proud or humble, but regardless, he or she has always been the subject of envy and praise. Your sense of who you are is defined your parent's reputation and by the expectation that everyone holds for you. Do you work twice as hard to prove yourself worthy of your family's reputation? Do you spurn your martial heritage to seek recognition of your own unique talents? Or do you hope to emerge from the shadow of your predecessor, ascending higher than he or she could ever imagine? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Bluff, Intimidate </p><p>Published in Martial Power 2, page(s) 153. </p>",
