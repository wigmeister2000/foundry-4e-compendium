			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Racial </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Dragonborn </p><p>Your clan claims at least one notable individual member or associated family, someone who has brought great glory to the clan's name. An ancestor might have been a great war hero or a benevolent ruler. A family associated with your clan might be renowned artisans or esteemed diplomats. Those who know your clan affiliation expect you to live up to your clan's high standards. They might assume you're arrogant or haughty before they even meet you. Or they might have a grudge against you, believing that your clan stole recognition that belonged to theirs. How do you react to your clan's renown? Are you proud of it, or is the burden of its high expectations too much for you to bear? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>History, Diplomacy </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook Races: Dragonborn, page(s) 9. </p>",
