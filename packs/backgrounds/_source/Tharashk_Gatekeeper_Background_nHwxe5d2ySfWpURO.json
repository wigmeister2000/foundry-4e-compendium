Whether or not you're a druid,you're accustomed to working with druids and in the wild places of the world. How did it feel the first time you encountered a seal you knew had a restive, eons-old demon behind it? Were you friendly with the Gatekeeper druids? Is there a particular lost seal you're still looking for and hoping to secure before the ravages of time unlock the demon beyond? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, Nature </p><p>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 157. </p>",
