			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Society </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p>You're of noble blood and descended through an unbroken Nerathi pedigree. You grew up with stories of your ancestors' wealth and prestige; you might even be the heir of an important Nerathi politician or of a self-styled \"emperor\" of a provincial region. Throughout your life you've been taught to respect your heritage and that you possess the power and imperative to be a leader of humankind. How has living in the shadow of your ancestors affected you? Do you have a feeling of entitlement, taking what you feel is owed to you for your ancestor's glory? Perhaps you feel the opposite-that your wealth and heritage brings the burden of responsibility to contribute something to a world spiraling into darkness. </p><p>Personal Quests: Discover the true line of your noble descent; use your family connections to restore order to a turbulent city; perform a deed of your own worthy to stand beside your ancestors'. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>History, Insight </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 393. </p>",
