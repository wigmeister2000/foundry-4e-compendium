			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Racial </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Halfling </p><p>Though you spent most of your time with the other members of your clan, you voyaged into other races' villages and towns whenever you could. Drawn to taverns and back alleys, you honed your skill at cards, dice, and other games of chance. Your need to find gambling partners might have drawn you into association with a \"bad element.\" Perhaps you're hiding out from powerful people who feel you cheated them. Did you run afoul of the law in a place where gambling isn't permitted? Were your cards too good too many times and you got accused of cheating? Does the desire to gamble drag you off course when you're supposed to be accomplishing a different task? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Bluff, Streetwise </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 381, page(s) 82. </p>",
