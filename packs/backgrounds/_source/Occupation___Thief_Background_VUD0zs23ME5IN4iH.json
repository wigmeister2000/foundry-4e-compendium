Were you driven to thievery by necessity? Were you part of a guild or syndicate, or harassed by one as an independent operator? Are you still a member or still hunted? If so, where is the guild based? If not, why did you leave-or why did the guild let you be? Was the parting amicable or are there people out there looking to settle a score with you? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Stealth, Thievery </p><p>Associated Languages: Secret Language </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 373, page(s) 8. </p>",
