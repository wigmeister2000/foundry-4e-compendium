But you are not truly what you appear to be. You are a creation-a child born not of body but of mind. You might have been formed to serve a greater purpose, or you could have been an experiment. Regardless of why you were made, the unnatural circumstances of your birth instilled you with unusual power. </p><p>When did you learn that you were different? How have you come to terms with your existence? Do you count yourself as a genuine member of your people? Have you told anyone what you believe? Have you uncovered incontrovertible truth that connects you to your presumed maker? And if not, how do you truly know what you are? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, Nature </p><p>Published in Psionic Power, page(s) 121. </p>",
