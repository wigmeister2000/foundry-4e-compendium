Called the white riders for their gleaming armor and the winter wolves they ride, the riders have a ferocity that fey peoples across the lands fear. You were a raider and innocent blood stains your hands. Why were you chosen to become a white rider? Whom did you raid? What experiences haunt you? If none, why did you leave the white riders? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Intimidate, Nature </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 384, page(s) 62. </p>",
