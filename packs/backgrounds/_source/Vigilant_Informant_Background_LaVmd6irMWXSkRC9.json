			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Adventurers </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Forgotten Realms </p><p>After having a tangle some time ago with the Vigilants, they offered you a deal-help them catch a violent criminal in the city, and they'd let you off the hook for what was surely a \"minor offense.\" You stuck your neck out and played their game, but the criminal escaped the city. The Vigilants kept their word with you, though, and they helped you back on your feet and even gave you some training. You still wonder what became of that criminal. Was your cover blown? </p><p>Recommended Feat: Vigilant Associate </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Streetwise, Thievery </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 376, page(s) 47. </p>",
