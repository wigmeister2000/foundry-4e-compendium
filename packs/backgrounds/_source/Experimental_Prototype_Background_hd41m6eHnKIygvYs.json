But the creators constantly made improvements and tried new techniques. You're one of the successful experiments-born of iron and alchemy, destined for greater things than your rank-and-file kin. The resources poured into your creation make you unique, and you find it difficult not to consider yourself greater than your peers. Do you still work for those who created you, or have you escaped their control? Has your superiority made you arrogant, or do you see a duty to use your gifts to help others? Were there any errors in your form that still cause problems? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Athletics, Endurance </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 385, page(s) 71. </p>",
