But why not replace it with something better? You're lucky to be a warforged. Creatures of flesh can't make the same upgrades you can. Your body has few original parts left-and good riddance! Does your fascination with modifying your body drive you to create homunculi or other constructs as well? If a new part becomes available, do you try it out though it might be dangerous? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, Thievery </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 385, page(s) 72. </p>",
