Nothing could have been further from the truth, as you had discovered something that broadened your horizons and set you on the true path to arcane power. Now, if they knew the truth, your teachers would probably brand you as dangerous. </p><p>What ultimately led you to forsake a more reputable arcane career? How have your choices affected your academic and personal relationships? Is anyone aware of your eldritch pact or is it still your secret? How would they treat you if they found out? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Bluff, Stealth </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 390. </p>",
