			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Racial </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Githzerai </p><p>You were raised and trained in a githzerai monastery in the Elemental Chaos or in a remote part of the world. You might have lived there your whole life, contemplating the dangers around you and binding your mind in rigid discipline. Something drew you away from your home. Perhaps you sought the answers to questions about your race's origin. Maybe a visitor to your monastery aroused your curiosity about the world beyond its walls. Now you find yourself outside the disciplined civilization of the githzerai. How are you adjusting? Is the experience intriguing or frustrating? Are new companions suitable replacements for those you left behind? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, History </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 9. </p>",
