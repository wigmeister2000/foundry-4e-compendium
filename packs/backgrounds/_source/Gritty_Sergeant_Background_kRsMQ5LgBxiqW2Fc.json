			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Campaign </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Scales of War Adventure Path </p><p>You've led people into battle and had them bleed on you as they died. But many of them lived to fight again. You've seen them come and go, sometimes so quickly that you never learned their names. Are there particular battles you remember well-or curse? Particular generals who wasted the lives of the those in your care? To what degree have you made the transition to civilian life? Ever get caught giving orders just like the old days, or are you glad to have that responsibility lifted from your shoulders? </p><p>Good Background: Human. </p><p><i>Benefit: </i>You gain proficiency in a simple or military weapon of your choice, and you gain a +1 bonus to initiative checks. </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 366, page(s) 57. </p>",
