The spirits you evoke are nature spirits of lakes, rivers, and rain, or animal spirits of fish, waterfowl, and songbirds. Water is everywhere, a sign of freedom that encourages you to stay on the move. You might come from a halfling tribe that wanders a marsh, a river, or a coastline. Or you could come from a city, where artificial pools and aviaries are your only connection to the spirits you revere. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Athletics, Nature </p><p>Published in Primal Power, page(s) 135. </p>",
