			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Campaign </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Scales of War Adventure Path </p><p>You grew up on the mean streets of an urban metropolis, and you quickly found safety amid numbers of likeminded poor youths. They taught you to fight, to steal (mostly from those who had something worth stealing), and to protect what little you had. How did you escape that life of poverty and petty crime? Under what circumstances will you go back? And what happened to your family friends in the meantime? </p><p>Good Background: Halfling </p><p><i>Benefit: </i>You add Intimidate and Streetwise to your class skill list, and you gain a +1 bonus to Intimidate and Streetwise checks. </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 366, page(s) 57. </p>",
