What more can you learn about them? Does their lack of ties to clutch and pack worry you? They might be untrustworthy. Why do they lie down and close their eyes for hours on end? Perhaps they are weak or lazy. Is it even possible for these creatures to be worthwhile clutchmates? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Diplomacy, Heal </p><p>Published in Dark Sun Campaign Setting, page(s) 23. </p>",
