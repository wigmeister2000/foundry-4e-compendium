You are as comfortable in the cold, lying on a bed of nearly frozen moss, as you are in a down-filled mattress next to a roaring fire. And your footing on the ice-covered slopes of the mountains is just as sure as on flat ground. </p><p>What has brought you away from your place within your tribe? Do you still revere the primal beauty of the cold North, or have you given up your tribal ways for something different? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Acrobatics, Nature </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 429. </p>",
