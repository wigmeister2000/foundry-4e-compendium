			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Racial </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Tiefling </p><p>You grew up on the streets, living on the wrong side of the law. One day something inside you changed, and you vowed not to live simply as one of the scum who scuttled through the alleys and sewers of the city. You clawed your way up through the ranks of the underworld until you led your own gang of thieves...at least for a time. </p><p>What set you on the path to becoming a gang leader, and what caused you to stop? Did something scare you straight? Did your gang commit crimes against the wicked and greedy, or were you less discriminating? Did your gang rely on simple burglary, or did you prefer more brutal tactics? What happened to your gang when you left? Do your former allies still respect you and can you rely on them for aid, or are you a pariah? Are you still wanted by some authority? Do your friends know about your past? </p><p>The cutthroat rogue or trickster rogue builds make good choices for this background, and the guildmaster thief is an obvious paragon path choice. As a warlord, you can use this background to explain how your character learned leadership skills. Consider the archer warlord build, perhaps even training in Stealth to use cover to hide and gain combat advantage. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Stealth, Streetwise </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook Races: Tiefling, page(s) 16. </p>",
