			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Occupation </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p>You were born into the circus and grew up among acrobats, performers, magicians, and animals. In your formative years, you showed a knack for feats of strength or dexterity, so you began learning from the performers. Living among the members of the circus made you tolerant of people who had alternative lifestyles. Although you never received a formal education, you learned many useful skills from the motley members of the circus. Your upbringing has left you with wanderlust, and it is this feeling that has driven you to explore a life as an adventurer. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Acrobatics, Thievery </p><p>Published in Martial Power 2, page(s) 154. </p>",
