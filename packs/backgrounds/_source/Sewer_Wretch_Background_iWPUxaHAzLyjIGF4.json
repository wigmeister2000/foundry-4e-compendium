			"value":"<p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p>Your family was poor, and you grew up in the Graves. There you learned to hunt rats, scavenge, and thieve to survive. You also encountered the strangeness that haunts the deeper and newer passages, the undead and mutants that prowl the dark. Proximity to such oddness might have awakened psionic powers in you or you might have become touched yourself, burdened with an unnatural corruption. Then again, you might have clawed your way free from the dark to claim a place in the light. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, Dungeoneering </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 392. </p>",
