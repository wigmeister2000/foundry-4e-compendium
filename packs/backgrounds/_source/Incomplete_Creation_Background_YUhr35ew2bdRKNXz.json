No, your \"birth\" was a fluke, and you were far from complete. Since your awakening, you've had to piece together the rest of your body from whatever you could find, using any techniques at your disposal. The alchemical substances you developed keep you alive and complete you, but they're mere patches, inferior to a complete original body. Was your creation forge shut down or destroyed before your completion? Did an accident awaken your consciousness, or did someone bring your incomplete body to life for a purpose? Do you consider the life you were granted a blessing or a curse? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, Endurance </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 385, page(s) 71. </p>",
