			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>House Medani </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Eberron </p><p>You've been where few people dare go: inside the Mournland. As part of a heavily armed, mounted column, you patrolled the periphery of what was once Cyre, trying to ensure that the Thrane and Brelish communities to the west stayed safe. What made you seek out such a post? What was your relationship with Channara d'Medani, head of the Thousand Yard Stare? What was the worst incident you ever saw on patrol? </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Endurance, Perception </p><p>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 155. </p>",
