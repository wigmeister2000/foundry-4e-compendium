			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Adventurers </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Forgotten Realms </p><p>As a child, you were always scrabbling for better things-good food, a nice place to sleep, clean clothes-and you took on any job to get them. Over the years, you've picked up many useful knacks that have served you well on the streets of Ramekho. Recently, you took on work with an adventuring party, and you found the work so much more exciting than your usual tasks that you've decided to stay on with them. </p><p>Recommended Feat: Ramekho Troubleshooter </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Heal, Thievery </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 376, page(s) 49. </p>",
