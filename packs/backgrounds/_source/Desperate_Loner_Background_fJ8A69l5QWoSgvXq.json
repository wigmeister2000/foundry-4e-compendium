Whatever the limits of your heroism, you find it nearly impossible to trust those closest to you. You are torn between a desperate need to belong and a certainty that, ultimately, everyone will abandon you when you need them. Torn between these extremes, you are gregarious and friendly-annoyingly so-but you also have a dark, pessimistic undercurrent that many fail to perceive. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Bluff, Insight </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 392. </p>",
