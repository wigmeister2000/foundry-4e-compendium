			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Adventurers </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>Forgotten Realms </p><p>You are from a well-born family in Sambral and have always lived in comfort. However, your temper has often got the better of you, and you were encouraged at an early age to take up a martial art to channel your inner fire. While you absorbed your training with gusto, it only fueled your haughtiness. When you killed a prominent citizen in a duel that escalated from a minor quibble, you knew that your darker moods had become a major liability. Your family ostracized you for your uncouth behavior, and now the only trade you seem to be suited for is that of a freebooting scoundrel. </p><p>Recommended Feat: Sambrese Rake </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Bluff, Intimidate </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 376, page(s) 49. </p>",
