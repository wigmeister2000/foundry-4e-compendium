Are you a wizard in the custom of ancient Nerath, or perhaps a simple scholar keeping alive the living light of humanity's mightiest civilization? You recognize that you and your order possess the most powerful symbol of ancient Nerath, but to what end? Are your efforts futile, or will they illuminate the path to greatness? </p><p>Personal Quests: Protect your shrine from looters; deliver an ember of your fire to another city and raise a shrine in its honor; reclaim the Flame Imperishable from the gnolls. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Arcana, Religion </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 393. </p>",
