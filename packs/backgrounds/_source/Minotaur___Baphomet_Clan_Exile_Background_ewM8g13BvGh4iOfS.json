			"value":"<p><b>Type: </b>Racial </p><p><b>Campaign Setting: </b>General </p><p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Minotaur </p><p>Your clan succumbed to the lies and promises of Baphomet's cultists, and all your living relations are in the thrall of the demon lord. You alone refused to bow to the Horned King, choosing to flee into exile rather than become a sacrifice on Baphomet's altars. Perhaps you swore to fight Baphomet in order to purify your people, or to exterminate your entire clan. Or perhaps you seek only to put that disaster behind you, to move on with your life and keep the beast in your heart contained. </p><p><i>Associated Skills: </i>Religion, Stealth </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 11. </p>",
