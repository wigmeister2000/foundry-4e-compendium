			"value":"<i>You inscribe a ring of sigils on a stone surface, bestowing it with the power to connect with portals.</i><p><b>Level</b>: 15<br/><b>Category</b>: Travel<br/><b>Time</b>: 4 hours<br/><b>Duration</b>: 24 hours (special)<br/><b>Component Cost</b>: 1,000 gp per square filled by the teleportation circle, plus 5 healing surges<br/><b>Market Price</b>: 10,000 gp<br/><b>Key Skill</b>: Arcana (no check)</p><p>You create a teleportation circle with a unique sequence of magic sigils, which you and other ritual casters can useas a location marker for rituals such as Linked Portal and Planar Portal. The teleportation circle does not transport creatures anywhere on its own—it merely enables other travel rituals. The ritual caster chooses the size of the teleportation circle, which in turn affects the ritual's component cost: 1 square, 4 squares (a 2-square-by-2-square area), 9 squares (a 3-square-by-3-square area), or 16 squares (a 4-square-by-4-square area).<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teleportation circle lasts for 24 hours, but the ritual caster can extend the duration by spending a healing surge every 24 hours to sustain it. The caster does not need to see or even be on the same plane to sustain the effect. If the ritual's effect is sustained without interruption for a year and a day, the teleportation circle becomes permanent.</p><p>Published in Manual of the Planes, page(s) 149.</p>",
