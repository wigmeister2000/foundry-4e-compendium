The teleportation circle does not transport creatures anywhere on its ownâ€”it merely enables other travel rituals. The ritual caster chooses the size of the teleportation circle, which in turn affects the ritual's component cost: 1 square, 4 squares (a 2-square-by-2-square area), 9 squares (a 3-square-by-3-square area), or 16 squares (a 4-square-by-4-square area).<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teleportation circle lasts for 24 hours, but the ritual caster can extend the duration by spending a healing surge every 24 hours to sustain it. The caster does not need to see or even be on the same plane to sustain the effect. If the ritual's effect is sustained without interruption for a year and a day, the teleportation circle becomes permanent.</p><p>Published in Manual of the Planes, page(s) 149.</p>",
