It is the  person you were at that time, and it approaches you with that perspective. You can converse with the spirit for the duration of the ritual. If you remember the right time in your own past to call on the spirit, you can question yourself when important knowledge is still fresh in your mind.</p><p>Published in Dragon  Magazine 430.</p>",
