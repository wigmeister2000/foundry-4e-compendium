A creature of a size that would normally have to squeeze through the area can instead move and act freely. A creature one size category too large to enter the space at all can instead do so by squeezing.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Arcana or Nature check result determines the maximum dimensions of the area affected.<br/><br/><table><tr><th>Arcana or Nature Check Result</th><th></th><th>Area Affected</th></tr><tr><td>9 or lower</td><td>Up to 1 square wide and 2 squares long</td></tr><tr><td>10–19</td><td>Up to 1 square wide and 4 squares long</td></tr><tr><td>20–29</td><td>Up to 2 squares wide and 4 squares long</td></tr><tr><td>30–39</td><td>Up to 2 squares wide and 8 squares long</td></tr><tr><td>40 or higher</td><td>Up to 3 squares wide and 12 squares long</td></tr></table><br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, a Huge creature with a space of 3 (9 squares) could freely move through an area 2 squares wide and could squeeze into an area 1 square wide. A Gargantuan creature with a space of 4 (16 squares) could freely move through an area 3 squares wide, and could squeeze into an area 2 squares wide, but would still be unable to enter an area 1 square wide. The ritual's effects last for 24 hours.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Optional Focus: You can extend the duration of this ritual indefinitely keeping a focus in the vicinity. This ritual focus is a small hand, sculpted of platinum, worth 100 gp. The Easy Passage lasts as long as the focus remains within the affected area. You can hide or protect the ritual's focus in any way you like, as long as it remains within the area defined by your Arcana or Nature check result.</p><p>Published in Draconomicon: Chromatic Dragons, page(s) 85.</p>",
