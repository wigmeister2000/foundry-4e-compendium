			"value":"<i>You impress upon the helpless anaxim before you its immanent destruction unless it serves you. It rises, ready to unleash its mindless fury when you next require its aid. You know that you only have a relatively short window before the creature reverts to a mindless threat.</i><p><b>Level</b>: 10<br/><b>Category</b>: Exploration<br/><b>Time</b>: 10 Minutes<br/><b>Duration</b>: Special<br/><b>Component Cost</b>: 400<br/><b>Market Price</b>: 1000<br/><b>Key Skill</b>: Intimidate</p><p>You target a dazed, stunned, or helpless Large or smaller anaxim whose level is less than your own. The anaxim must remain within 5 squares of you for the time necessary to perform the ritual. Once the ritual is complete, the anaxim follows you, avoiding direct danger and refusing to follow instructions other than the one: attack a group of foes.<br/><br/>Upon receiving this verbal instruction, combat begins. The anaxim fights until the foes you indicate are destroyed or until it is destroyed. The anaxim uses basic attacks each round except on rounds when you expend a minor action to urge it to use one of its other attacks.<br/><br/>When the combat ends or the ritual's duration ends, your influence ends and the anaxim reverts to its natural behavior; it simply leaves unless you attack it.<br/><br/>Your Intimidation check determines how long the anaxim is affected by the ritual and follows you around as it waits to be activated for combat.<br/><br/>Intimidation Check    Result Duration<br/>19 or lower                6 hours<br/>20–29                       12 hours<br/>30–39                       18 hours<br/>40 or higher              24 hours</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 375, page(s) 83.</p>",
