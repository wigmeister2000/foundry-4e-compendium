No matter what the target does, touches, walks through, or experiences, the target's person, clothes, and carried possessions are not soiled. If the target is in any way soiled when the ritual is completed, that filth is immediately shed. Attacks or other effects that involve dirtying the character work as normal but leave no lasting waste or residue.</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 366, page(s) 29.</p>",
