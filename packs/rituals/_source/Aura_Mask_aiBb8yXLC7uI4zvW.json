			"value":"<i>Before your eyes, the wondrous object shimmers briefly and then returns to an apparently mundane state. Though you know the truth of its power and value, to others it appears normal in every way.</i><p><b>Level</b>: 8<br/><b>Category</b>: Deception<br/><b>Time</b>: 10 minutes<br/><b>Duration</b>: 24 hours (special)<br/><b>Component Cost</b>: 10 gp<br/><b>Market Price</b>: 250 gp<br/><b>Key Skill</b>: Arcana</p><p>When performed upon a magic item, Aura Mask makes it appear nonmagical when someone tries to use an Arcana check to detect magic. Your Arcana check result determines the DC for the Arcana check to see through your deception. The Arcana check DC to determine that an item is magical is the higher of the item's normal DC or the result of your Arcana check made as part of this ritual.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ritual's effects last for 24 hours.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Optional Focus: You can extend the duration of this ritual indefinitely by leaving the item near a small, jeweled eye of gold and ruby wrapped in a silken blindfold. The blindfolded eye is a focus worth 100 gp. As long as the item remains within 20 squares of the focus, the Aura Mask remains in effect. You can hide or protect the ritual's focus in any way you like, as long as it remains within range. A single focus can maintain up to five Aura Masks or False Auras on five separate items, as long as they are all close enough to the focus.</p><p>Published in Draconomicon: Chromatic Dragons, page(s) 83.</p>",
