			"value":"<i>Your senses reach to the horizon when you will it.</i><p><b>Level</b>: 16<br/><b>Category</b>: Scrying<br/><b>Time</b>: 10 minutes<br/><b>Duration</b>: Special<br/><b>Component Cost</b>: 3,600 gp, plus a focus worth 2,500 gp<br/><b>Market Price</b>: 9,000 gp<br/><b>Key Skill</b>: Arcana</p><p>Farsight functions as the Wizard's Sight ritual, but you can place your scrying sensor in any square you can see, no matter how far. You can see and hear as if you were standing there, and you have darkvision through the sensor. Use the Perception skill to determine whether you hear quiet sounds or notice unobtrusive things while observing an area through the sensor. You cannot place the scrying sensor in a location you can see only through a scrying sensor.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Arcana check result determines how long the sensor lasts.<br/><br/><table><tr><th>Arcana Check Result</th><th>Duration</th></tr><tr><td>19 or lower</td><td>2 rounds</td></tr><tr><td>20–24</td><td>3 rounds</td></tr><tr><td>25–29</td><td>4 rounds</td></tr><tr><td>30–39</td><td>5 rounds</td></tr><tr><td>40 or higher</td><td>6 rounds</td></tr></table><br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ritual creates a scrying sensor—a shimmer in the air—that watchful creatures might notice. Creatures must succeed at a  Perception check with a DC equal to 10 + your level to notice the sensor. They can't disrupt or interact with the sensor in any way.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sufficiently powerful warding magic, such as the Forbiddance ritual, can block Farsight. If the location is warded in such a manner, you learn that as soon as you begin the ritual, so you can interrupt the ritual and not expend any components. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Focus: A mirror or a crystal ball worth at least 2,500 gp. The focus conveys what you see and hear.</p><p>Published in Arcane Power, page(s) 155, Dragon Magazine 366, page(s) 29.</p>",
