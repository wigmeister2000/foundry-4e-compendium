			"value":"<i>You create an invisible ward that prevents stray thoughts from  getting in or out of your territory, unless you permit them.</i><p><b>Level</b>: 14<br/><b>Category</b>: Warding<br/><b>Time</b>: 30 minutes<br/><b>Duration</b>: 24 hours (special)<br/><b>Component Cost</b>: 1,600 gp, plus 1 healing surge<br/><b>Market Price</b>: 4,200 gp<br/><b>Key Skill</b>: Arcana</p><p>No telepathy or other mental communication can cross the boundary of Voicecatcher Veil, unless the creature using it is either of a higher level than the ritual caster who performed the ritual, or that ritual caster permits it. When mental communication is attempted across the ward's boundary, the ritual caster is instantly aware of the attempt and the contents of the message. The caster can then choose to bar the message or let it pass, as long as the caster is capable of thought. (If the caster is incapable of thought or dead, the veil automatically bars all communication.) The ritual caster can pass this power and responsibility on to another creature in the presence of the veil by spending a healing surge; that individual can likewise pass it to another by the same means. Your Arcana check result determines the size of the warded area, which is a burst.<br/><br/><table><tr><th>Arcana Check Result</th><th>Warded Area</th></tr><tr><td>9 or lower</td><td>Burst 1</td></tr><tr><td>10-19</td><td>Burst 3</td></tr><tr><td>20-29</td><td>Burst 5</td></tr><tr><td>30-39</td><td>Burst 8</td></tr><tr><td>40 or higher</td><td>Burst 12</td></tr></table><br/><br/>The warding effect lasts for 24 hours, but the ritual caster (not any assistants) can extend this duration by spending a healing surge every 24 hours to sustain it. The caster does not need to be in the same area or even on the same plane to sustain the effect. If the ritual's effect is sustained without interruption for a year and a day, the effect becomes permanent.</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 366, page(s) 33.</p>",
