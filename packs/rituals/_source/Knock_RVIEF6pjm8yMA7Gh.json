			"value":"<i>A blue, glowing key appears in front of the door and disappears into it. The door glows amber for a moment and then unlocks.</i><p><b>Level</b>: 4<br/><b>Category</b>: Exploration<br/><b>Time</b>: 10 minutes<br/><b>Duration</b>: Instantaneous<br/><b>Component Cost</b>: 35 gp, plus 1 healing surge<br/><b>Market Price</b>: 175 gp<br/><b>Key Skill</b>: Arcana</p><p>The Knock ritual allows you to open a single locked door, chest, gate, or other object. It even works against portals sealed with the Arcane Lock ritual or doors secured with bolts or bars that are on the far side, out of reach. You must defeat all the closures on a locked object to unlock it. You make one Arcana check per lock, bar, Arcane Lock, or similar closure. The object you unlock does not open automatically; you still must open it yourself after the ritual unlocks it.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make an Arcana check with a +5 bonus in place of a Thievery check to open each lock or closure. (See the Thievery skill description, page 189, for example DCs.) To undo bolts or bars you normally couldn't reach, you must succeed on a DC 20 Arcana check. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you use this ritual successfully against a portal protected by Arcane Lock, you destroy the Arcane Lock and its effects end.</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 307.</p>",
