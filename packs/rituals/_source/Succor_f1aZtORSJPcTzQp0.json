			"value":"<i>A site sacred to your deity is always open to those in need.</i><p><b>Level</b>: 20<br/><b>Category</b>: Travel<br/><b>Time</b>: 8 hours<br/><b>Duration</b>: Permanent until discharged<br/><b>Component Cost</b>: 5,000 gp, plus 4 healing surges and a focus worth 5,000 gp<br/><b>Market Price</b>: 25,000 gp<br/><b>Key Skill</b>: Religion (no check)</p><p>You must perform this ritual inside a shrine, a temple, or some other site of religious significance to your deity. Succor attunes the ritual's focus to the site, linking the two until the ritual is discharged. After the time required to perform the ritual, the creature holding the focus can spend a standard action to activate the ritual's effect: At the end of the creature's next turn, the creature and up to eight willing creatures within its line of sight teleport to the holy site to which the focus was attuned, and the ritual is discharged. Succor crosses any distance and planar boundaries.<br/><br/>Any effect or condition that prevents teleportation also prevents this ritual from functioning (but does not discharge it).<br/><br/>Focus: Prayer beads, a holy book, or some other item of religious significance.</p><p>Published in Divine Power, page(s) 158.</p>",
