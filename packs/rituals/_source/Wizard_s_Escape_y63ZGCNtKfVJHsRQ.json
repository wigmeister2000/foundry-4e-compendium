			"value":"<i>The guard looked on with horror as the prisoner squeezed between the bars of his cell, his face and chest distorting in a fashion that should kill—or at least disfigure—him, then returning to normal.</i><p><b>Level</b>: 6<br/><b>Category</b>: Exploration<br/><b>Time</b>: 10 minutes<br/><b>Duration</b>: 10 minutes<br/><b>Component Cost</b>: 150 gp<br/><b>Market Price</b>: 520 gp<br/><b>Key Skill</b>: Arcana (no check)</p><p>For the ritual's duration, you and up to eight allies can squeeze into and through spaces that a Tiny creature can squeeze through, allowing them to fit into crevices, under some doors, and through most barred gates or walls. An affected creature must still squeeze to fit into a space it could not normally enter. How this ritual manifests varies from caster to caster: It can allow creatures to squeeze their body as though boneless, to step through half-dimensions, ripple into and out of smaller shapes, or anything else.</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 366, page(s) 33.</p>",
