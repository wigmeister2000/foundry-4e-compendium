			"value":"<i>The terrain erupts in a flurry of activity as the land leaps to your command, erecting a shelter for you and your companions.</i><p><b>Level</b>: 10<br/><b>Category</b>: Creation<br/><b>Time</b>: 30 minutes<br/><b>Duration</b>: 8 hours<br/><b>Component Cost</b>: 200 gp<br/><b>Market Price</b>: 1,000 gp<br/><b>Key Skill</b>: Arcana or Nature (no check)</p><p>You create a sturdy lodge large enough to accommodate eight Medium creatures. The ritual uses materials found in the area, so the lodge can be formed of snow, stone, wood, or even sod. The lodge encloses a close burst 4 in size. The interior is dry and clean and includes nine bunks, a long table with stools, and a writing desk.<br/>The shelter is not heated or cooled, but it is immune to fire and impervious to all damage. Access to its interior is by two shuttered windows, a single door, and a chimney. Furniture can be removed from the shelter, but it vanishes along with the lodge when the ritual's duration expires.</p><p>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 118.</p>",
