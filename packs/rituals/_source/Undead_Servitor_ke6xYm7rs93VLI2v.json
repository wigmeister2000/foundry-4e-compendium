			"value":"<i>The corpse shudders, then clambers to its feet. At your direction, it shoulders your gear and lumbers after you.</i><p><b>Level</b>: 6<br/><b>Category</b>: Creation<br/><b>Time</b>: 1 hour<br/><b>Duration</b>: Permanent<br/><b>Component Cost</b>: 150 gp<br/><b>Market Price</b>: 360 gp<br/><b>Key Skill</b>: Arcana (no check)</p><p>You imbue a humanoid corpse of natural origin and Medium or smaller size with the ability to move under its own power and an understanding of one language of your choice. It has speed 6 and Strength 16, never tires, and obeys you at all times.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead servitor is a noncombatant. When forced onto an active battlefield, treat the servitor as an allied minion (1 hit point, never damaged on a missed attack) with all defenses of 11. It acts just after you do and never makes attacks.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot have more than one undead servitor at a time from different performances of this ritual. If you attempt to create a second servitor, that ritual fails without component expenditure.</p><p>Published in Open Grave, page(s) 50.</p>",
