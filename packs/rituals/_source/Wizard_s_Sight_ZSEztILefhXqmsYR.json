			"value":"<i>You extend your senses beyond the door, looking and listening inside as if you were there. </i><p><b>Level</b>: 8<br/><b>Category</b>: Scrying<br/><b>Time</b>: 10 minutes<br/><b>Duration</b>: Special<br/><b>Component Cost</b>: 270 gp, plus a focus worth 200 gp<br/><b>Market Price</b>: 680 gp<br/><b>Key Skill</b>: Arcana</p><p>When you perform a Wizard's Sight ritual, choose a square within 20 squares of you, even a square that you can't see or don't have line of effect to. You create a magical sensor in that square. You can see and hear as if you were standing there, and you have darkvision through the sensor. Use the Perception skill to determine whether you hear quiet sounds or notice unobtrusive things while observing an area through the sensor.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Arcana check determines how long the sensor lasts.<br/><br/><table><tr><th>Arcana Check Result</th><th>Duration</th></tr><tr><td>19 or lower</td><td>1 round</td></tr><tr><td>20–24</td><td>2 rounds</td></tr><tr><td>25–29</td><td>3 rounds</td></tr><tr><td>30–39</td><td>4 rounds</td></tr><tr><td>40 or higher</td><td>5 rounds</td></tr></table><br/><br/>The ritual creates a scrying sensor—a shimmer in the air—that watchful creatures might notice. Creatures must succeed on a Perception check with a DC equal to 10 + your level to notice the sensor. They can't disrupt or interact with the sensor in any way.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>Sufficiently powerful warding magic, such as the Forbiddance ritual, can block Wizard's Sight. If the location is warded in such a manner, you learn that as soon as you begin the ritual, so you can interrupt the ritual and not expend any components.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Focus: A mirror or a crystal ball worth at least 200 gp. The focus conveys what you see and hear.</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 315.</p>",
