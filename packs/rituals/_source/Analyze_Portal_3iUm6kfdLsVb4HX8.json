Analyze Portal causes the portal to erupt with faint lights that flicker and spin, letting you learn a great deal about its destination and function. Its most basic effect is to reveal the portal's destination. Although a portal usually displays what its destination looks like, this ritual reveals the destination's name and its general location in the world or the plane on which it is located.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you learn the origin and type of the last creature to use the portal, you also learn any keywords associated with that creature.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analyze Portal can also reveal the identity of the creature that created the portal. If no creature created it, you learn of the event that created it.<br/><br/><table><tr><th>Arcana Check Result</th><th>Information Learned</th></tr><tr><td>29 or lower</td><td>The name of the portal's destination</td></tr><tr><td>30 or higher</td><td>The origin and type of the creature to use it last</td></tr><tr><td>30 + one-half creator's level</td><td>Identity of the creature that created it, if any</td></tr></table></p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Player's Guide, page(s) 142.</p>",
