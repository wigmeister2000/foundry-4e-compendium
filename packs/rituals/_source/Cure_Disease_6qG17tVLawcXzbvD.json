			"value":"<i>Even the most horrid affliction disappears in response to your healing touch.</i><p><b>Level</b>: 6<br/><b>Category</b>: Restoration<br/><b>Time</b>: 10 minutes<br/><b>Duration</b>: Instantaneous<br/><b>Component Cost</b>: 150 gp<br/><b>Market Price</b>: 360 gp<br/><b>Key Skill</b>: Heal</p><p>The Cure Disease ritual wipes away a single disease afflicting the subject, whether the disease is active or still incubating. The subject is completely cured and loses any negative side effects and symptoms of the disease.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ritual is physically taxing to the recipient; if used on an injured character, it can even kill him or her. Upon completing this ritual, make a Heal check, using the level of the disease as a penalty to this check. The result indicates the amount of damage the character takes. Assuming the character survives, this damage can be healed normally.<br/><br/>Heal Check<br/><table><tr><th>Result</th><th>Effect on Target</th></tr><tr><td>0 or lower</td><td>Death</td></tr><tr><td>1–9</td><td>Damage equal to the target's maximum hit points</td></tr><tr><td>10–19</td><td>Damage equal to one-half of the target's maximum hit points</td></tr><tr><td>20–29</td><td>Damage equal to one-quarter of the target's maximum hit points</td></tr><tr><td>30 or higher</td><td>No damage</td></tr></table><br/><br/>If you know that your subject is suffering from multiple diseases, you must choose which one this ritual will cure. Otherwise, the ritual affects whichever single disease you knew about. You learn the disease level when you begin the ritual, and at that point you can choose not to continue, without expending any components.</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 303.</p>",
