			"value":"<i>Your powerful ward channels all attempted teleports across its boundary into a location of your choosing.</i><p><b>Level</b>: 18<br/><b>Category</b>: Warding<br/><b>Time</b>: 30 minutes<br/><b>Duration</b>: 24 hours (special)<br/><b>Component Cost</b>: 7,000 gp<br/><b>Market Price</b>: 20,000 gp<br/><b>Key Skill</b>: Arcana</p><p>Any teleportation attempted across the boundary of the ward created by this ritual goes awry, instead depositing the creature(s) attempting to cross that boundary through teleportation in a square within 100 squares of you that you select during the ritual. If that square is occupied, the affected creature appears in the nearest unoccupied square. Your Arcana check result determines the size of the warded area, which is a burst.<br/><br/><table><tr><th>Arcana Check Result</th><th>Warded Area</th></tr><tr><td>9 or lower</td><td>Burst 1</td></tr><tr><td>10–19</td><td>Burst 3</td></tr><tr><td>20–29</td><td>Burst 5</td></tr><tr><td>30–39</td><td>Burst 8</td></tr><tr><td>40 or higher</td><td>Burst 12</td></tr></table><br/><br/>The warding effect lasts for 24 hours, but the ritual caster (not any assistants) can extend this duration by spending a healing surge every 24 hours to sustain it. The caster does not need to be in the same area or even on the same plane to sustain the effect. If the ritual's effect is sustained without interruption for a year and a day, the effect becomes permanent.</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 366, page(s) 32.</p>",
