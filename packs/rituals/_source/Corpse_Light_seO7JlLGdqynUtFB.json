			"value":"<i>A sickly green flame springs forth, washing the area in nauseating light. In its illumination, those that walk in undeath are revealed beyond a doubt.</i><p><b>Level</b>: 2<br/><b>Category</b>: Divination<br/><b>Time</b>: 10 minutes<br/><b>Duration</b>: 1 hour<br/><b>Component Cost</b>: 25 gp<br/><b>Market Price</b>: 100 gp<br/><b>Key Skill</b>: Arcana or Religion</p><p>You create a pale green flame that illuminates as a lantern. The light emanates from an object you designate during the ritual. The green fire produces no heat.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any undead creature that enters the illuminated area or is within it, and that is of a level equal to or lower than your Arcana or Religion check â€“ 10, is wreathed in a green, flaming aura that harmlessly flickers around the creature. This aura appears even if the undead is disguised by a polymorph or illusion effect. Invisible undead are surrounded by visible green radiance. The glow reveals the square in which the undead is located, but it does not affect the total concealment granted by invisibility.</p><p>Published in Open Grave, page(s) 49.</p>",
