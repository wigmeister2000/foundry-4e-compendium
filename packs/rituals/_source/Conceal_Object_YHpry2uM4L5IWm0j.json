For you, the safest place to hide something is wherever you want.</i><p><b>Level</b>: 10<br/><b>Category</b>: Deception<br/><b>Time</b>: 10 minutes<br/><b>Duration</b>: Permanent<br/><b>Component Cost</b>: 400 gp<br/><b>Market Price</b>: 2,000 gp<br/><b>Key Skill</b>: Arcana</p><p>One object within 5 squares of you becomes difficult to notice, no matter how obvious it is. Any creature with line of sight to the object is entitled to a Perception check at a DC equal to your Arcana check result with a +5 bonus. A creature that touches the object gains a +5 bonus to the check, and a creature that is rudely forced to notice the object (such as by walking into a wall it was unable to notice) automatically sees the concealed object. Moving the concealed object ends the effect.</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 366, page(s) 27.</p>",
